# A Love Letter to Broadway


Broadway theatre, also known simply as Broadway, refers to the theatrical performances presented in professional theatres, each with 500 or more seats located in the Theater District and Lincoln Center along Broadway, in Midtown Manhattan, New York City.

This [Shiny app][shiny] built in RStudio is created to send my love to Broadway.

The dataset is made available by the Broadway League and organized by Austin Cory Bart from the [CORGIS Dataset Project][dataset]. The marvelous design is from [David Smale][design].

Let's have fun playing with this interactive Shiny App and see what you can find out about Broadway shows!

## Dataset
The dataset stretches from the 1990s to August 2016, and only shows that reported capacity were included. Due to upload issues to shiny, the interactive word cloud is deactivated in the app. The dashboard has the following tabs:

*Intro
*Running Weeks
*Price
*Broadway Theatres
*The Book of Shows
