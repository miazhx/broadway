" 	I was not expecting to enjoy this but had bought tickets for my husband as a present. We went with friends and didn't really know what to expect. The theatre was quite small and the talt of our party was ft and was still quite squashed so not sure how tall people would cope. The show itself was fantastic! There was a lot of swearing but it was also very well written"
" 	Although we are not sorry we went to see this production we cannot help but think we probably are not theatre people. For $ per ticket U.S. i just think i could have taken a taxi to New  for a Devils game or like my wife said maybe go see  s or   or .

" 	I was hoping The Book of  would show up on the TKTS board while I was in NYC. It didn't and I have a feeling it never does. On my last day there (a Saturday)"
" 	""love this musical albeit a bit risqu?? it was laugh out loud funny. It is not for everyone though and I did advise a friend that she may not like it. By the makers of South Park it is a hysterical critique of the missionary's journey to Uganda to civilise the natives with the Good News of the Book of  but it could be any radical Christian group that often head to third world countries to bring their """"truth"""". It is intellectually stimulating and funny send up of this scenario. Acted out well by the entire cast who keep you entertained and laughing throughout the production. Great night in NYC. I took my teenager and she love it but it is definitely for mature audiences and I would definitely research it before jumping in if you are offended easily.""

" 	""I enjoyed the musical but I found myself feeling slightly disappointed because I expected much more. It was funny"
" 	I'll begin with full disclosure. I am an evangelical Christian. I firmly believe that God has a sense of humor. Should I have laughed? Yes. Did I laugh? So much my sides hurt. This was the fastest  / hours I have ever experienced. The acting was wonderful...the music was wonderful...the costumes were wonderful (be sure to pay close attention to the details in the costumes...hilarious...broom brist and old Christmas tree toppers!). This is one I'm glad I saw on Broadway and one that I will see time and time again...here and with the traveling troupes. 			The Book of 	I'm ashamed"
" 	No preaching allowed. Just a hilariously irreverent smash and bash musical comedy. What else should you have expected from the South Park folks. The unexpected. 			The Book of 	Irreverent boisterous must see musical	Brad M	--	"
" 	Definitely not a show if you are easily offended and can't see the metaphors beyond the literal word. Acting and singing was superb and the set is very intricate. Would definitely recommend not bringing kids under  (it's raunchy like the movie Ted). Great job by Stone and Parker helping everyone realize faith is more important than anything else			The Book of 	It was even better the second time around	Izzy D	--	"
" 	I was a little skeptical about this play because I am not a huge Southpark fan. My husband and I agreed we would each pick one play to see on our trip and this was his number one pick"
" 	My daughter appreciates the South Park humor at age . She thinks the writers are the most brilliant in satire and music. She was so excited when we were lucky enough to win the lottery tickets outside the theater for a Wednesday matinee. Every show has  extra tickets to raffle off. You just show up between  and  and a half hours before the show and put your name in a bucket. Two hours before the show they draw the names and you pay $ a seat. FRONT ROW AND FRONT BOX SEATS!!!! Otherwise tickets are hard to get without paying a fortune. We were front row center - what a great show!!!!			The Book of 	Best Musical Ever if you love the South Park Humor	nightsky	--	"

" 	Truthfully I did not fancy this musical but friend got tickets and Im so glad he did. I never stopped laughing from the first song to the very end.

" 	This was the most damned awful play I have ever been to. it was totally vulgar throughout.... what a piece of crap. I could have spent $ a whole lot better in a casino. It was full of vulgar language and filthy innuendos all the time. I can't believe people cheered. This just shows how the morals of American have been degraded over the last  years!!

" 	The highlight of our New York visit. Outrageously funny"
" 	This was our first Broadway show and it was so much fun. We had front row seats to the stage which was fun being so close to the actors but did limit some views. I thought it was smart and funny but not as crude and rude as I expected. 			The Book of 	Lots of fun	kdxdana	--	"

" 	I'd vote: don't go if you are ultra conservative or super right wing!  There were also two actual (and extremely young) elders in the crowd. Needs to say they were shocked.

The actors are perfectly cast and there will be moments where you wish you could pause and rewind as there is so much going on that you want to watch it again to make sure you didn't miss anything. Funny"
" 	Be careful who you take to this side splitting hysterical play. Not everyone can enjoy this type of bawdy"
" 	Genuinely a really funny show. Not one to take anyone who you think might be offended by the material or the very young. It's really South Park on stage. All criticism is for the theatre. The legroom is the worst I have ever experienced and I'm not over six foot. Drinks were really expensive even considering the location. It was worth it for a really funny show.

" 	My wife got tickets for the show based on reviews she read and from a recommendation from an acquaintinance she knows. I was going into an event dragging and kic. It turned out to be quite an enjoyable and comedic evening. The actors were all very talented and good at their craft. The storyline was sharp and engaging. If you enjoy comedy"

The ticket lottery happens two hours before the show where they pick about - tickets and pick names out. The winner gets two center orchestra tickets for  each. We did not win but we ended up nd in line and got two great seats.  The show was worth the wait. It is a bit vulgar and not for the devout who may take offense at religious humor.

The tickets are expensive but if you are an avid Broadway musical fan then this show is well worth the splurge. The show was witty and very funny. I don't recommend going uns you can get decent seats in the orchestra section. As it is the theatre"
" 	I didn't know what to expect"
" 	""I've waited a long time to see this show. I'm so glad that I got to see it on broadway. We paid a lot of money for tix and it was worth every penny. What a hilarious show performed by a group of young and very talented people. They sang and danced and delivered each line perfectly. The entire show was extremely entertaining. Be forewarned that the theater seats are uncomfortable. The guy seated next to me asked for another seat because he was claustrophobic. He was reseated and I had a little bit of extra room which was nice. I'm '"""" and  lbs. my knees were forced against the chair in front of me and I was shoulder to shoulder and thigh to thigh with my friend seated next to me. I'm used it that though.

The seats are good. You're not swimming in comfort but you're not cramped like a sardine.  The only annoying thing was when they asked for donations.

Of courses this is New York so even the performers in the chorus are top drawer. The only thing that didn't fully work were two or three spots when the timing seemed off - almost as if lines were forgotten. That seems to be a directorial issue rather than any flaw with the actors. This was definitely one of the best theatrical evens we've attended.

" 	We didn't go to the Broadway show but we say the touring version. There was no place to give a review for that but I wanted to review this because I had reservations about going myself and there are so many mixed reviews. I knew my husband would enjoy the humor but didn't know if I would. It was funny and the jokes were not all aimed at what I call  yr old boy humor like I was worried it was as South Park does sometimes. Not for anyone that is easily offended as the humor is inappropriate a little racial and some might be offended if they are super religious but I am not easily offended and profanity does not bother me so I enjoyed it. Was smart in the delivery of it's message. love all the characters. Pokes some fun at religion but I don't think it was really offensive to any. Set change were flaws. We love it and was glad I went. We had lots of fun and I thought it was really funny. It lasted around . hrs with  min reservation and it flew by because we enjoyed it so much.			The Book of 	Pleasantly surprised	tomorrow	--	"

The theatre was smaller than I expected but there was a great atmosphere!

I attended this with family members with very different tastes in entertainment and from different age groups. I would suggest attending with friends from the same age group.

" 	From beginning to end you will be laughing. It was so much fun. I've never watched South Park as it does not appeal to me so can't relate it to that as others have but I was thoroughly entertained by this show. It moves quickly and made me wish it had a sequel or was a series as it was so entertaining and fun. Some people might be offended but it is a type of humor that appeals to many more than it will offend. Everyone I know that has seen the show has absolutely love it including the humor. The acting was excellent and it was very engaging. For a really fun night"
" 	Oh my gosh"
" 	Definitely one of the best musicals I've ever seen. We all absolutely love this and if it wasn't so expensive we'd see it again as I'm sure there was loads we missed from laughing so much. Absolutely incredible that they manage to get away with some of this - this is not just close to the mark"

" 	I thought that after seeing Josh Gad twice as Elder Cunningham that anyone else would pale in comparison. Granted the new cast paled a little bit but the story and the fullness of the cast contribution continues the value of the show and I will definitely see it again. It is a fairly rough indictment of the  religion and the first time I saw it"
" 	What an extremely funny musical! It made fun of out of almost everything it could and not just s. There were people of all ages at the theatre and everyone seemed to enjoy it. We had tickets for only $ because they were right in front of the stairs and so they had limited space for your legs. Since they were almost at the highest row of the theatre"
" 	""This musical is not for the faint of heart or for the prudish kind. The musical is highly irreverent and uses foul/coarse language. While it does make fun of the s per se"
" 	""I am always amazed when people complain about language or any offensive humour the show clearly states """"Adult humour"""": so why did they go"
" 	We had a  day childfree break to New York and had booked tickets to see The Book of  and we totally love it! Given it's written by the same people as South Park I should have guessed just how crude it was going to be - but I hadn't - but we didn't mind that. Although I can imagine it would really offend some people! I've often seen musicals where I've already known the storyline and songs and so was concerned going into this without knowing anything about it would make it s enjoyable - but if anything it was more so!

" 	We love this show! Absolutely fantastic cast. Wonderful music and production numbers. Humor in unexpected places. The message of believing in what you believe even when presented with many horrible human behaviors may be lost for some. The comedic presentation of the  church while offensive to some earlier reviewers did really not make fun of the religion. The humor of being sent to Uganda for ones two year mission when the dream has always been to go to Disney world is a simple example. My caution is that references to body parts"
" 	The musical was hiliarious and raunchy and definitely irreverant. I would recommend that you get seats in the middle section but not closer than row  as it is a small theatre and if you are too close it is difficult to see the whole set and cast of characters.

" 	I had never been to a Broadway show. I was hoping to get rush tickets the morning of the matinee which are cheaper but no luck. I paid full price.??  I wasn't thrilled to spend that much for a  minute show but I was blown away with the performance. There was no intermission which is good as the story kept flowing. The staging was phenomenal. Minimal props and a rotating center that turned and changed configuration allowing several different settings to be imagined. The musicians are right up on stage but you hardly notice as they are discreetly hidden behind the trees. I'm Canadian so I was watching for iconic Canadian and Newfoundland items and authenticity - they were quite evident.  The performers blew me away - they slipped in and out of various accents and clothing pieces as they portrayed several characters each. I cried several times as this side story of how  affected others out of the immediate vicinity but we're still tied to it in many ways played out.

It does make you laugh and I was fighting back tears more than once. Amazing that someone could actually sit down and figure out how to tell so many different stories and scenarios in one play and have them all come across so clearly and so well.

A few sad moments given the subject but overall fun and funny. The actors play multiple characters and flip between them frequently throughout the show by changing jackets or hats. Music was awesome. Singing and acting were great. We were surprised by having the real life couple in the audience that were portrayed in the the show as they met during this ordeal and stayed together ever since (sorry I don't remember their names).

" 	I would never have imagined you could create such a wonderful musical from the story of how airplanes were diverted to Canada immediately following the - disaster in ! But WOW! did the artists behind such an underta 'knock it out of the park'!!! The story line and music/lyrics captured the essence of the indomitable spirit of humanity and man's care for his fellow man when in distress.

I'm planning to watch again later this year.				Entertaining!	WithTheLaughingFace	--	"

" 	This was our st Broadway show and it was much more then we thought it would be. The singing and acting were world class!! Huge sets and big production exciting characters gave a fresh spin on OZ!! The theater is large but almost every seat looked to have a decent view!				Impressive!!	MarkMac	--	"
" 	?????ù is the back story of the all-too-familiar Wizard of Oz. It explores the friendship of Elphaba (the  Witch of the West to most of us) and Galinda (Glinda the Good Witch).

" 	This has been on my bucket list for years. I was almost ready to wait until the touring version came closer next year but then I found out about Theater Week in NYC and the price was right so off we went.  The show was everything I hoped for from start to finish. The music was wonderful and the actors were awesome in their ro. I didn't want it to end.  The theater was comfortable as were the seats We were in Row R - orchestra section. My only complaint was the prices for drinks and souvenirs. $ for a mixed drink. The only reason I got it was because I wanted the glass that came with the drink. I really would have love to have done the photo op. It looked like a lot of fun and a cute souvenir but for $! You would think by lowering the prices more people would purchase. I didn't see hardly anyone buying anything.				Had a  Time!	joenronnie	--	"
" 	Absolutely stunning. love the performers"
" 	This show is a must see! I've been trying to see this in New York and Florida for years. I finally planned a trip to New York and purchased these tickets in advance. The stage setting was well done and the costumes were stunning. Such intricate design and beautiful fabrics"
" 	My daughter and I have seen   times at the Gershwin and twice on tour. It never gets old! Amazing every single time!! The Gershwin an absolutely awesome theater. It is worth every penny and then some!!				Can't see it enough!!	shellhutch	--	"
" 	compared to some shows in new york this was quite pricey"
" 	This play was quite comical which I did not expect. The actors had a good rhythm between them and made the play very entertaining. It has a different twist than the original Oz you seen with Judy Garland.... the actors jived together well and had strong voices so you could hear everything. I would definitely go see this play again. I went to the  pm show.				ly entertaining is true	wjm	--	"
" 	Is one off the best musical I EVER see"

" 	Wasn't so sure if I'd enjoy this"
" 	I took my wife to this as she really wanted to see this. This wasn't my first choice but I really enjoyed this show. The cast were excellent and I enjoyed the humor of the show. The woman who played Elphaba was incredibly talented and the highlight of the show. This show is well worth seeing.				Fantastic show 	Rehsinup	--	"
" 	Before arriving in NYC I knew that I % wanted to go see  on Broadway. I have seen it back home"
" 	Booked see  in New York last week. Theatre in heart of Times Square.  Went to box office had no problems getting  brilliant seats on the day. It was amazing from start to end. Have seen may live shows and this is definitely one of the best. All cast great. Glinda character very funny made the audience all laugh at same time"
" 	I'm not a musical fan but I was blown away by this. Funny"
" 	Spoiler alert! Won't do it; however everything you thought about the story of Oz has been turned upside down. But what I will tell you is the performance"
" 	I finally saw this show! I entered the lottery every day for months to get orchestra seats for $ and I finally won. The show lived up to the hype. The two main leads"
" 	Pros: - convenient location - many food nearby -very good performance  -stage effects -voices and story is very nice  -touching and outstanding performance  Cons: - merchandise area is too small and too crowded for me to get any souvenirs  Overall I recommend this show as I never know the story was such touching and expected one. Amazing performance and stage effects. Make me feel want to watch other shows too!!! 				Amazing "

" 	Had seen  when they were doing a UK Tour- but it takes it to a whole new level seeing it on Broadway- especially when this was my first experience of a Broadway show.

" 	I sat in the front row"

" 	Best show I've seen !!! My best friend and I had heard great things about  and it exceed all our expectations! The acting"
" 	Very spectacular"
" 	As I stated Glinda stole the show for me. Carrie St. Louis played Glinda and wow she made the show funnier and more emotional at times. The entire cast was very great! Adding their own unique takes from the original cast. I was impressed by many specs of the story line as it is rough at the start to follow then becomes more clear adding in the story line of many things that came into the movie"

" 	Good Show it is a bit long. The production is amazing and the costumes are phenomenal. Everyone in the show does a great job. The theather is very comfortable and enjoyable. The greeters at the door are a bit much they go through your bag and make you check all food or drinks. I had closed candy from the M&M store and she was very nasty saying I should have went after the show. Guess what I went before and I'm not a child and I'm not chec food I intend to eat or give away later.				Good Show	Tasha H	--	"
" 	Again"
" 	What a show! Never had a boring moment. Glinda made everyone laugh throughout the entire show. Both hers and Elphaba's voices were amazing. Gave me goosebumps just to listen to them sing. The story made so much sense; an excellent twist from the classic story. This was actually my second time watching the show. The first time was over  years ago"
" 	I have always wanted to see  for  years and I finally got to go. I was a little worried that it would not be as good as I hoped it would be considering how long it took me to finally get out there to see it. But I love it. It was so moving and I confess that I cried at the intermission and again at the end because it was all that I hoped it would be. I know that it seems to be a big hype but it actually is really good.				The Only  Thing I Have Gone to And I love It!	Hannah N	--	"

" 	Glenda and Elphaba are dynamic characters. They are enemies and friends and the engaging story is classic with some twists along the way!

" 	I have seen numerous Broadway shows ranging from Avenue Q to Mama Mia. This is still my all time favorite show. It really makes you think about the Wizard of Oz and see the other side of the story. If you've never seen the Wizard of Oz (which I would find hard to believe) rent it first before seeing the show. You will love it and encourage everyone to go see it. My number one tip is don't pay full price. There are numerous sites you can go on and register for free where they will send you discount codes or you can frequent the website to find them out. I never pay full price and don't you either.

If we hadn't paid over $ each for premium seats in the second row we wouldn't have stayed to see the show through to it's conclusion. We stayed only to see if it could get any worse. The current cast is way below par. Timing was regularly off. Crew and cast were regularly seen wandering around the edges of the stage area.

This was an awesome show that showcased some of the best acting and talent I've ever seen. I can't wait to go back to see this again. I would recommend this show for people of all ages.

" 	What is there to say? I've seen this in the West End twice & it was a great choice for my first Broadway musical :) we booked months in advance for front row seats through Ticketmaster. Once inside we also treated ourselves to the themed cocktails which seemed steep at $ but you do get to keep the cups (hooray!) We bought more at the interval because they were delicious too. I had so looked forward to it & would go back in a moment. Theatre was easy enough to find too. We went to the Will-Call desk to pick up the tickets about an hour before curtain up as we happened to be passing. When we returned later the queue was quite long"

The acoustics in the Gershwin theater make some of the lyrics in the songs hard to understand.  The actress who played Glinda was hilarious and definitely stole the show but it wasn't enough.

Saw many men yawning and first out at intermission. Several young male students from a private school were sound asleep in their seats!!! Very annoying to see and hear food and drink in the theatre- cellophane crackling and ice cubes banging in the glasses. Surely people don't have to be eating at all times!!

" 	Went with my mother and sisters and sat about  rows back center in the Gershwin theater. The theater is unlike many other Broadway theaters since it is more spacious with more stadium-like seating so don't need to worry about sitting behind a tall person or getting claustrophobic. I thought the cast was great particularly the actresses that played Glinda and Elphaba. I struggled with the singing in the ensemb as the words got mumbled in the chorus. I'm not sure if it was a sound issue or just the acoustics of the theater when the whole cast sings. Admittedly"

" 	I have been very bsed to see many shows on Broadway in my lifetime. So when a friend who had never been asked if we could go on a trip to see a show I said sure. They picked  (which due to illness I missed seeing years ago when I had tickets) The show was amazing. Jackie Burns as Elphaba and Chandra Lee Schwartz as Glinda breathe a life into these charachters that can't and shouldn't be missed. They have a chemistry and true love of theatre that you can feel pulse through you The show flys bye. You just never want it to end. In a world where there is so much to see on Broadway this is the one of  shows I am already planning to see again. It is something to be honest I would want to see again and again. When youre a little kid you go on rides at carnivals and they are so good when it's over all you want to do is go on again. This is the adult version of that. Curtain calls ended and all I wanted to do was sit down for curtain up to see it again right then!! To those of you not familiar with Broadway shows this is a great one to see as there is some familiarity with charachters as you all know them from the Wizard of Oz so they are there to guide you. To you seasoned Broadway pros if you haven't seen this you are not the pro you think you are and are seriously missing out Stop reading what I am writing and go buy tickets and GO SEE !!!!!

We went to the afternoon showing on a Saturday and it was the highlight of our trip by far. We spent the rest of the trip tal about it and singing the songs. The Gershwin theater was beautiful. While searching for tickets I saw a lot that had """"obscured views"""" so we decided to spend a little more money on tickets in the middle of the theater. While in there I looked at these so called """"obscured view"""" areas and did not see anything of such. Every seat in the house would have been great since the theater is smaller.

" 	This was my first experience going to a broadway show and I was skeptical about going at all (people singing for three hours??). We decided on  because of reviews and because it was a different story about familiar characters.

" 	I'll be honest-I haven't watched the Wizard of Oz so a lot of the jokes and references went over my head. My wife has been berating me ever since for not watching it! It is a very good show though and it is a very slick performance. The tickets (like all Broadway shows) were not cheap however and the cocktail drinks (with souvenir plastic glasses) were $ for two drinks which is slightly on the excessive side. To be honest"

" 	It used to be that musicals had melodies that people could remember (Jesus Christ Superstar) and stories that moved you (Fiddler on the Roof). 's music sounds like a Broadway musical with all the melodies removed. The story is what you'd expect in these politically correct times--that someone who is born different and shunned because of her differences ends up being the hero in the end.

" 	The musical was wonderful. Saw a pm show which seemed to be sold out. We had orchestra seats at the end of the right side of the stage. I was worried about having a blocked view but it was just fine. My husband liked sitting on the end with no one next to him and right by the entrance/exit doors. I wasn't disappointed with purchasing the cheaper tickets. You couldn't see the very back of the right side of the stage but I didn't miss a thing. The actors are mainly at the front the entire time. I'd actually choose those seats again. I was one of the first ones to the restroom at intermission as well. 				Great Show For All!	JLK	--	"

We were fortunate to be there for Carol Kane's first night back as Madame Morrible. The production is wonderful and there's nothing objectionable for kids so it's a very family friendly play. We had orchestra seats and had a close view of everything but the way the theatre is designed it seems like you have a nice view from everywhere. Lots of souvenirs for sale -- we had to indulge in a couple of t-shirts and drinks in the  souvenir cups. We had such an amazing time and I highly recommend this play for all ages!				Fantastic!!!

It was great to have the return of Katie Rose Clark who is superb and her co-star Lindsay Mendez plays so well off her and you can tell they have fun as they and the cast give you all your money's worth and more. P.S. Carol Kane (remember the spirit of Christmas past in Scrooged)as Madame Morrible was such a super plus with that wonderfully unique voice"
" 	My boyfriend got the tickets for my bday (it is very expensive...) and the play was very nice. not the best i have seen in nyc but maybe it was because its more for families.

Both the lead ro were performed to perfection and were both very funny. Much more than I was expecting. All very polished but still relaxed and seemingly ad-lib. The chorus performers were also very impressive with the right amount of quality singing and broadway blast. I believe this show is suitable for kids and adults alike"

We had good seats at the back on the ground level. The only problem was the dragon was obscured at the start but not a problem for the rest of the musical We didn't know the story line so bought the programme. You did get a free play bill(like a small programme) which was a good as the programme. The main characters were outstanding and appeared to give it their all. Overall a wonderful experience.

" 	So maybe you have seen  the traveling show in a city near you and never bothered to see it in NYC as I did for many years. However this is a must see show in NYC! The story behind the story of  is amazingly entertaining and eye opening itself and to see it at the Gershwin Theater with the permanent set and a talented cast will just blow you away. I have seen the show two times on Broadway and three times around the country and I strongly recommend you see it at the Gershwin in New York City. Where your greenest outfit and indulge with an Oztini! Seats are difficult to come by so plan in advance or be open to stopping by the Gershwin Box Office just an hour or two before the show for single seats. We were able to grab two single seats that were right in front of each other for the face value price which is much cheaper than the aftermarket. Oh and  is never available at TKTS"

" 	I've seen  twice. The music is amazing and the whole spectacle of the show is worth a repeat visit.  My only issue with the show is that I'm not big into spectacle (not their fault) and I wish any of the characters were likeable. I find it hard to get emotionally connected to something if I don't like anyone. But I fully admit that's my own thing.  You'd think after so long on Broadway you could get tickets cheaper or at TCKTS. Alas"

There is a bar in the theater and beverages are served in a cup with lid which can be brought into the theater which is nice. But snacks need something similar.

" 	"" by far is one of the top musicals on Broadway as well as touring the country. I've seen it several times and have never been disappointed. The actress playing Elphaba is phenomenal as well as the actress playing Glinda. The musical is based on Gregory MaGuire's book on the untold stories of the witches of Oz and not the one as we know it by Frank Baum. Therefore there are plot twists and additions to make the story interesting. The musical numbers soar along with the signature piece """"Defying Gravity"""". It is currently playing at the Gershwin theater which is an attraction in its on right. Inside this theater are large plaques of yearly lists of the best actors and actresses from Broadway. It is always interesting to see who made the list for the current year. You can also dress up on the mezzanine level and have your photo taken as a character and by digital imagery placed right in the middle of the Emerald City. Please note that there are scary sequences with the dragon on the proscenium that may frighten young children. The winged monkeys have and always will be my favorite part of the show. Strong performances are given by the actors playing Fiyero and Boq as well as the wizard himself. I don't want to spoil to show but this is indeed a show not to be missed!!""

Totally entertaining and something that only Broadway can do.No tour could come close to the spectacle. Enjoy- its worth the hefty price... but make sure you plan way ahead for great seats.. and dont sit to close- you need to take it all in!				A Must see Broadway extrvaganza	Jane C	--	"

" 	This was a real treat. I had really avoided going to the play considering what it was about but went after so many people love it. They were all right. The theatre is terrific but its the unbelievable cast that is so eyepoppingly amazing that you just can't believe it. The story"
" 	""The show was amazing! My  year old daughter and I love every minute of it! The cast was great! What a wonderful experience. We sat left of the stage row B which is about maybe  rows back. The seats were great but next time we will probably get center stage seats. The Gershwin was smaller than I expected so I assume there are no """"bad seats"""" . Definitely a must see!   ""				Wonderful wonderful wonderful	lorims	--	"
" 	I really liked . I had actually not known what the story was about but went to see it because it had great reviews and we wanted to see a Broadway show. Well we finally got to know more about the good witch and the bad witch right? The bad witch was not bad at all and the good witch was not so good after all. I love and would go see it again when I can. It teaches us that our first perceptions may not always be true especially if we do not know the facts :)				It was  good	FabGlobetrotter	--	"

" 	""I was disappointed. I love being transported to another world with a great musical"
" 	We visited here with high expectations and were really loo forward to being wowed in what is a beautiful theatre. We found the plot slow to develop but did enjoy the second act more. I guess we expected the special effects to be more breathta. The lead characters were well played. Glinda delivered a great performance and some good comedy one liners"
" 	 was soooo good! You will never look at the Wizard of Oz the same again. The music was fantastic and the story is extraordinary. You will realize why the  witch of the west is green and why the flying monkeys are so loyal to her"
" 	I've seen this show twice"
" 	Wow what a great show very American entertainment"
" 	 is an amazing musical and I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it. The music is by far amazing and Steven Schwartz has done an amazing job with it! I fell in love with the musical the second it started and have not stopped listening to the music since. It is a must see on broadway and I would recommend it to anyone. I went with a school group and I don't think their was one person that did not enjoy it. As music students"
" 	I'm watching this for the third time and I've never been disappointed! This is easily the best show currently running on Broadway. DO NOT MISS! It's a must see especially if you wanna be surprised. And if you wanna be blown away. 				Magnificent. Three times over	ThisIsBadax	--	"

" 	As part of a short trip to New York we had decided to include a trip to a broadway show and as it was virtually impossible to get tickets for  in the UK... We booked tickets for the Wednesday matinee and...Wow!! Lilli Cooper was an outstanding stand-in as Elphaba. If this is the quality of a stand-in then I understand why this show is so popular.

" 	I have seen this show a dozen times now and always enjoy something new in the interpretation. The Broadway production is outstanding starting with the quality of the Gershwin Theatre. You really can't get a bad seat. I've won the lottery and sat in the front row and I've also sat up the back and still had the energy of the cast reach me. I have a friend in the show so I've also been lucky to have had several back stage tours. The Stephen Schwartz lyrics and score are sublime and Winnie Holzman has done a stellar job on adapting Gregory Maguire book. The costumes are wonderful"

It has lost none of it's freshness and the new interpretations of the current cast are excellent. The actress playing Glinda is playing it very broadly and she is hysterical. And the voice of the current Elphaba is not to be missed. And I saw the original with Idina.				If you only see one Broadway show"

" 	We have seen this show  times and it was just as entertaining the second time around. The better seats are in the lower level as you cant see the stage as well from above and you tend to miss some of the effects and the emotional connection that makes the experience memorable. The show has great comedy and storyline of the  witches before they became the ones form the movie in the Wizard of Oz. It takes you thru their journey of becoming witches and how they learned to control their powers. It is great for all ages and a must see if your in NYC.

" 	 will be playing on Broadway for  years come this October. We have always wanted to see it but something has always come up. We finally went and it was worth waiting for. The Gershwin Theatre is an excellent venue with comfortable seating with good leg room and excellent sight lines. The story and staging were very clever. The leading actor's voices were magnificent. The power of Jackie Burns voice is something you need to experience. Surprisingly the show touched several themes which are very relevant today. Very enjoyable experience!				Finally saw  and glad we did!	Kbarrelle	--	"
" 	My teenage daughter and I came to NYC for a weekend of Broadway.  certainly did not disappoint. We had seen it before. BUT... seeing it at the Gershwin with the Broadway cast"
" 	Wife and I booked well ahead and literally sat front row and center. Great story and show. It moves quick and having these types of seats were definitely worth the price of admission. The Gershwin Theatre was very cozy and historic. Would recommend this play if you???re thin of shows to see on Broadway. Very close to good restaurants and bars"
" 	Highly recommend trying to get lottery tickets if you???re on a budget. They were $ a piece and we were able to get two tickets. Amazing show"

" 	Really fun show. The leads were unbelievably talented. They nailed every single note to perfection. The story is an intriguing take on the Wizard of Oz...a prequel if you will. The sets were beautiful and the music was fantastic! This is exactly what I was hoping to experience on my first trip to the Big apple!  A word of warning...rest up"
" 	Unbelievable production. Would watch again. Best I've ever seen. There really aren't that many bad seats. The venue had limited food and drink. Very expensive drinks. $ aud for a Pepsi. The intermission is short so don't expect to stock up on supplies from the bar. 				Brilliant	Solutionj	--	"

" 	""This is an unusual immersive experience. You enter into the world of this """"hotel"""" and wander about and see all sorts of strange and seemingly unconnected things. I'm glad we did it as it was so different than sitting and watching a play"

" 	I visited with a group of friends"
" 	We attended Sleep No More back in  when it was rather new and found it to be very enjoyable"
" 	Dramatic with some loose ends I went to this show now in February"
" 	This special different show is a unique entertainment. This play is something that everyone experiences differently. If you don't like spooky settings"
" 	This was unlike any performance I have seen but I really enjoyed it. Perfect if you are travelling solo as you can't talk to anyone anyway! Get there early to catch the first performance as it becomes difficult to keep up with the actors when the full crowd arrives. Running shoes are ideal if you are keen to keep up with them. You also have more opportunities when their are s people for the rare  on  interactions. Bathrooms are on the th floor down a long corridor. Stay until the last banquet scene as it is the climax of the show. It helps to at least know the synopsis of MacBeth as this background really helped me put the scenes I saw together. Great show and really enjoyed the night.			Sleep No More	Early early early	Nick D	--	"
" 	Very different from any other show we've seen! In case you like surrealism - this is the show for you! Be aware it take almost  hours and lots of wal stairs.			Sleep No More	Amazing surrealistic"

" 	I'm a keen Punchdrunk supporter and their NYC show Sleep no more is everything a fan of immersive theatre can hope for.  Yes"
" 	Practically the play doesn't work. It's shown in a really large space (several floors) and at most times there are many people crowding around  or  actors. There was hardly any dialogue"
" 	Try not to read about it or research it. Just take the words of everyone who has done it and go. You won't regret it. An amazing night"
" 	This experiential theatre show may not be for everyone"
" 	This place had the potential to be cheesy but it is incredibly well done!  A maze of different rooms and settings each dramatically different and authentic. Definitely with a visit.  A good place to get lost and separate from your friends"

" 	If you like being on the Ghost Train amusement ride then you'll love this show. If you're not a kid then"
" 	Its hard to explain exactly what Sleep No More is like until you are immersed in it. It is an experience that you should do alone. What I mean is that while you will probably go with a large group of people"
" 	Like the title says"
" 	We booked through an agency ?? cocktail d??ner on the roof top for  people. The weather last friday in NY was really windy and rainy. Very very Cold on the terace"
" 	Sleep No More is something that no two people can ever have the same experience. It can be quite spooky as its like a real life Choose Your Own Adventure book. You follow the actors around and watch their stories"

" 	If I was to sum up this show in one word it would have to be WOW! My daughter saw the Burning Man production by the same theatre company in London and she was desperate to go to this show. I was a little skeptical mainly because the tickets were expensive and I had no idea as to what to expect. But my concerns were unfounded and if you only do one show in New York"
" 	""Wow. Didn't know what to expect with this"
" 	I have been to three Punch Drunk productions and Sleep No More once. The first time I went I was blown away. The second time not so much. I don't want to give anything away because the experience is best when you have no prior knowledge. All I will say is that they seem to be letting in too many people per show now because the last time I went"
" 	First off"
" 	My boyfriend is not at all a theater fan (he found the Broadway show we attended kind of cheesy)"
" 	This became a must see for me in every visit I make to NYC! The experience is extraordinary! This is not a conventional theatre play"
" 	we ate dinner at the theme hotel restaurant which was interesting and pricey. Found myself searching for meaning in hindsight I ask myself why? Why did I have to work so hard"
" 	My cousin took me here after loving it the first time she went. I didn't know what to expect but it turned out to be a fun filled night. You can explore different floors & rooms of the hotel & follow different actors or scenes. It's really interactive & challenges you to be adventurous & curious.

" 	This felt like the quintessential NYC experience. Interactive theatre in trendy Chelsea. Try the very strong Absinthe cocktail before the show and be brave.  It is based on Shakespeares Macbeth"
" 	I can't really put my finger on why this production of MacBeth works"
" 	My husband and I went to see Sleep No More over the th of July weekend. Maybe all of the actors were on vacation that weekend? Anyway"
" 	A very unique experience and totally love it. Be curious and open minded will be helpful.  Enjoyed exploring the scenes and had fun trying to figure out the connections(difficult to see the full picture tbh but still very much enjoyed the interaction). It's an intimate experience that you can follow and breath with actors when the plot was developing. Checked the mirrors and you may find the masked audience being like s attached to actors to seamsly become part of the story. There will be crowds especially if you're following the main characters. Actors will smoothly create more spaces to act if too many followers. Although no dialogues involved"
" 	This interactive play is loosely based on Macbeth. You follow the cast over a  storey warehouse. This is one of my highlights of N.Y. I don't want to say too much and give it away			Sleep No More	Great experience	ssshelley	--	"
" 	It may be truer to say that the more you put into this the more youll get out of it. Im still a bit unsure about this as I think this is an excellent idea it was not as memorable (or immersive) an experience as it could have been.  I think if you do some research beforehand (I didn???t) this may enhance your experience. I am not familiar with Shakespeare/Macbeth or what you might call the vocabulary of dance so didn???t get that much out of it. Some speech would have helped. I was there on Saturday but it wasn???t too packed"
" 	""Two friends and I were in town on business and wanted to find a show to see. I had heard recommendations for """"Sleep No More"""" and suggested it to them. We each bought tickets ($ + $ convenience fee)"

" 	""This show is an """"emperor's new clothes"""" situation. No one wants to admit they didn't love it. It???s a great idea that is poorly executed; Save your $+ from this money grabbing tion and enjoy something more meaningful in NYC.  The money part - you pay $ + fee"
" 	Go without knowing much. Then lose your friends and explore the details"
" 	Very disappointed. Perhaps my hopes were set too high after hearing raves about this experience for years. I am a fan of experimentation and the unusual"
" 	My wife and I saw this for the first time about  months ago and it was so good we came back.  This is one of the best pieces of interactive theatre I have even seen.  On this occasion they forced us apart which actually allowed us to see and discover more.  A request for people who attend - don't push yourself on the artists and don't crowd them and push others out of the way.  I found people just overly pushy and at times a couple of people crossed the line between being interactive to outright rude and interfering.  If you haven't seen this before"
" 	""SNM was my favorite thing that I did in my trip to NYC. Since it was our first time in the city we had a little difficulty finding the hotel"
" 	Yes"
" 	Boring"
" 	""Extremely disappointing! The """"experience"""" reminded me of modern dancing - and we did not get it...  The building is a -floor maze taken from the mind of a lunatic"
" 	""We first went to """"Sleep No More"""" last fall. I was a bit apprehensive because of the """"structure"""" of the performance. Everyone has to wear a mask (very uncomfortable for someone who wears glasses). There is no tal once you get your mask on until the very end. Basically this takes place in an old warehouse (maybe?) with five floors to roam around in. It is all very mysterious. Once you find an actor to watch you can follow him/her around from scene to scene. Apparently the """"play"""" is loosely based on Macbeth. I had never read or seen the play"
" 	Booked tickets following a recommendation from friends who have seen the Drowned Man between - times... so had high expectations! The best bit for me was right near the start where I stumbled into the Rave Scene - totally nuts!! There were a couple other scenes great too"

" 	This is really an amazing experience and well worth the price (which is"
" 	Sleep No More should not be missed. Each person wears a Venetian style mask and tal to others is not allowed. (this is done so that each person experiences their time there in their own way.) The group is brought to different floors of the show and told to explore. You can roam from room to room and floor to floor. You can open desk drawers"
" 	We went for a private event of  the room and building is way to small for that. Dinner was provided but was not very good. This is an interesting event but some direction should be given . You are left to wander from floor to floor with no sense of direction . You are forced to stand and eat with no place to sit anything. We were not given access to all rooms but what we saw was intriguing. Music was well done 			Sleep No More	Confusing 	BillJKnight	--	"

" 	""I took my husband to see Sleep No More following dinner at The Heath. Dinner wasn't the best. The Vegetable """"stew"""" was a bunch of green vegetab floating in a thin tastes broth. We were rushed through dinner -we had seven o'clock reservations but were told that we wouldn't have time to order a full meal because we had to be ready for the show at .  My recommendation for """"Sleep NoMore """" is to be sure to stay for the grand finale at  pm.No one tells you that there is a grand finale"
" 	This play is so edgy that it falls over the other side. Interactive"
" 	""This show was the most unique theatrical experience I have ever had. The set was interesting enough without the action. Then the moving story unfolding in various rooms and on different floors kept us engaged for the whole evening. I have seen it twice"
" 	So if you are loo to try something completely different then you have to go and see this show. I would actually say you have to see it more than once to get the just of it. That was also according to people we met in the line waiting to see it for the nd time.			Sleep No More	Strange "
" 	I wasn't sure what would happen when I got to this place but it absolutely blew my mind.  Forget what you think you need to know about Shakespeare as it's irrelevant. There's a loose connection to the Scottish play and mostly it's like a total time warp film noir crazy wild mystery as to what is going on. You could probably see this  times before you thought you had a handle on the story line. Even if you go with friends"
" 	I did a lot of research on this. It was SO well worth it and I will without question go back again! Actors/dancers are amazing. This show is PERFECTLY done. They didn't miss a THING. It was incredible and I will recommend it to anyone I know! Just a side note: For that jerk offs that talk and MUST take their phones in with them (even though it says you cant) STAY HOME you ruin the experience for the rest of us! I told people to shut up quite a few times. It is RUDE! Respect the actors and the art of the show and follow the damn ru!			Sleep No More	AMAZING!	ana_bella	--	"

" 	I have seen ad gone to a lot of theater and Cirque and experiences from the 's. This has to be one of the most memorable and amazing experiences I have ever had. This is not for the passive need to be told everything to do type. This is an experience that only works if you are curious and put yourself in the middle of the action. You will be alone at times and you WILL have to make decisions and trust me you will never see it all. Wear comfortable shoes and have at least one drink in you before you put on your mask. Your mind will be blown and you will images for the rest of your life. Try to find the WHOLE story and don't try to follow just one character. This cast is attractive and there is a type for everyone. Enjoy that because it gets better and better. Also try to stick it out until the end. Mandalay is where I want to live.

The masks sit uncomfortably over glasses if you wear them which makes moving around the very dark spaces more troubling. Apparently the best way to explore the place is to separate from your party or partner and wander on your own. But two of the near-sighted of our group needed escorting through the darker areas so we had to stay together. But fortunately this allowed us to see the ridiculous side of the experience.

We entered at the earliest possible time to get the most out of it and right after getting inside we split up by choice. Some coup appeared to try and stay together but it really is more enjoyable exploring on your own. There were some times that I was getting bored wondering where the action was and then all of a sudden I would stumble upon an amazing scene.

I still do not know if I was supposed to follow just one actor or more than one. I personally followed whoever was running in front of me and at the end though I did not understand much.

" 	Going in I knew it was about Macbeth (that's key here) - and there's a second story line intertwined (without giving too much away its a little Hitchcock) ... That helped me from being terribly lost (in the story plots) and yet I was lost in the building. I tried to leave the first floor for at least  minutes and couldn't find a way out - once I did it was more fun. Its not for the faint of heart (i don't like spooky things and it took me a while to acclimate to the fact that no one is going to jump out at me and scare me half to death). Its very pricey and very interesting. You have to wear comfortable shoes there is a lot of wal (there are  floors to explore).

So much detail was put into the entire production that it makes you really appreciate everything you see.  Dinner at the heath was incredible. % recommended before the show.

" 	Was coerced into going to this show which proved to be one of the more painful experiences I had to endure. Perhaps I'm just not the artsy fartsy type to appreciate the premise and didn't feel compelled to pretend I liked it for the sake of appearing trendy and posh. It was too overcrowded and fragmented of a presentation for me to enjoy the experience. After an hour of exploring I bolted and headed back to the hotel while everyone was still toiling in the maze. For the more logical types I would suggest catching a Broadway Show.			Sleep No More	No sir"

" 	""If you are a visitor you should definitely give it a try as you will not come up with anything similar in your home town most probably. It just feels like being part of the movie Eyes Wide Shut yet deeper and more mesmerizing. My advice is that if you are a couple definitely break for the show so that you will have interesting stories to tell each other and find out more about it. Wear comfortable shoes"
" 	There's no stage. There are no seats. You are part of it and you are in it. The whole building is the stage with all its floors and labyrinth of rooms and scenes. There is no coherent plot and you form your own line of story by following the actor you choose. You switch from one story to another when you meet the other character on the stairs... And there as almost no words spoken. Superb physical-dance-acting. Exceptional design of the set.			Sleep No More	unique theatrical experience	Shahar K	--	"

" 	Sleep No More was my most anticipated 'to do' on my NYC trip list but sadly it did not live up to my expectations mainly due to the throngs of people there. The actors were fantastic and emotive as was the ambience of it. The choreographed dance/fight scenes were just great but the place was packed and people were bumped and pushed out of the way by others as a constant which really ruined a lot of the moments.

Actors can be close up and personal and there are private one on one interactions if you are lucky enough to find them.  Don't miss the late after party in the Mandalay Bar. Bands and vocalist are very good and music is special. Enjoy yourself"

Two ways to enjoy the show: Explore all the rooms or follow a character everywhere. At times the characters do repetitive things.  The story is kind of based on Macbeth but even if you have read the book you might not be able to relate to all the scenes.. Overall I think this was above average but not out of the world. Not sure if I would go back again.. They also have a mandatory $ coat check per person (that includes coat and handbag). Tip:Try to get tiks for Tuesday show"
" 	It was the best adventure I've had in awhile. Set the time machines way back Sherman. I love the speakeasy before the show and maybe the cabaret show afterwards was my favorite BUT this show is well done and complex - so it's not all tied up in a nice box with a bow on it at the end it was fabulous to observe.

" 	After hearing very good reviews about Sleep No More we decided to go with another couple and open minds. We went on a Saturday night and purchased the tickets with a reserved table at the bar. We knew that it was based on Macbeth but otherwise had no idea what to expect. We all appreciate the arts and the theater but this was difficult to follow. You would absolutely need to return to make sense of the different scenes. The scenery is well done and they certainly use the space beautifully. I found the experience to be frustrating. We spent a couple of hours in the play and then all met back in the bar. The positive side to this event was the bar - the live music is good and the girls wor are absolutely delightful. We did buy a program on the way out to see if it would provide some additional insight into the different rooms and characters but even that was unclear. I believe the intent is that you go back and experience this in many different ways but I wouldn't spend this kind of money for the experience.			Sleep No More	Interesting Experience	Santucci	--	"

" 	""We had an awesome time running through this hotel to catch all the cool performances from this group of talented actors. The bar is very cozy and everyone talks like the roaring 's. Fun to try to get them to mess up about modern times. they stay in character no matter what. We love the shadow dance scene in """"the Woods"""" and many others. Don't be afraid to step up and join in if asked. Be prepared to walk and run up and down stairwells and follow characters to the next scene. Highly recommend for anyone who is interested in different experiences and Art. love it. we will go back again with friends.""			Sleep No More	Interactive and entertaining	OhioTexican	--	"
" 	This is no ordinary show.  It's a different experience.  It's very well made indeed and has the most amazing actors and actresses.  We had so much fun visiting this event.  If you want something different while here in New York go here.... I gave it a  because it's worth a .  It has some nudity and a bit of violence"
" 	(Visited on //) This was the best theatrical experience of my life. I'm still not sure what was going on"
" 	""First of all"
" 	This is avant garde theatre on the biggest scale I've ever seen. The set itself is just spectacular! And the dance performances were breathta! My boyfriend and I got separated by accident but it was actually a bsing in disguise as we both ended up seeing completely different things and it was a lot of fun trying to piece together our different experiences :) A note for everyone tho"
" 	This person who created this show must be talent and creative human!! What a good idea can approach actor/actress so much when watching a show. Besides"
" 	I honestly don't even know where to begin with Sleep No More"
" 	Sleep No More was recommended to us while we were in New York recently. We were almost put off by the price tag but after the recommendation and tripadvisor reviews we were quite curious! The experience is based on Shakespeare's Macbeth and immerses you in the live theatre act. The main ru require you to wear a mask and remain silent. My words can not do the place justice! After handing over our belongings we headed up to the bar but were quickly summoned to the preparation area. You are encouraged to enjoy an individual experience rather than staying with your group and I agree that this works really well. Multiple scenes take place at various locations within the hotel across multiple floors. Despite being there for  hours"
" 	Hands down the best experience of my life.  Intense theatre that makes sure you are engaged every minute.  It is an avant garde form of theatre. So creative in its concept that I was blown away in the first  minutes itself and after that i was entranced. Just following the characters "
" 	I had this recommended by three close friends so I thought I should give it a go.. we had the Maximilian's package"
" 	I don't want to say much and ruin the experience for anyone. The s you know"
" 	It was a very interesting experience... a beautifully expressive show. Comfortable shoes are an absolute necessity"
" 	""This is one of the coot"
" 	What an experience! Leave your expectations and inhibitions at the door! Just go with it... Although you may find yourself leaving completely confused"
" 	A total waste of my money and my time. It was crowded and boring. The most overated thing ever! Too many people so you need to fight to see anything"
" 	I went to this great experience last August. We were two coup and I almost dragged the group into it. They entered not convinced at all and when we met at the end everybody was excited and with a tale to tell about what they saw. That's the magic of SNM"
" 	Imagine yourself running after an acter with  more people and when arriving to the next scene you don't see anything because it is too crowded. If you do manage to see"
" 	We got recommended to this place by a friend of ours. Needs to say we love it! If you have plans to go to a play or performance"
" 	Wor in theatre myself"
" 	If you want to see New York from another perspective"
" 	""I get that this show isn't for everyone but it was defintitely for us. Reading the negative comments just made me realize that you have to go to this with an open mind and be prepared to experience something really cool and different. It's what you make of it and I was blown away by how unique this experience was and how talented the people in the show are.  The problem with writing a review for this show is that you really can't do it justice by trying to explain it to people. You just need to go!! I CAN tell you that it is immersive theatre. You can follow the action from room to room or stay and see what happens in the scene where you are. There is five floors in this """"hotel"""" and you can wander around wherever you want and spend as much time in any area as you want to. You will just keep coming upon scenes that are being acted out. My husband and I stayed together which I preferred. Some people must prefer to experience this on their own because I saw lots of people wal around solo. I feel like just saying that will confuse people.  Upon entry everyone is given a mask to wear so that we are all anonymous because you can get pretty up close and personal with the actors. The masks are very comfortable so don't worry about that.  Finally"

" 	""I would only recommend this play (or whatever you want to call it) to people that is OK about being violently tricked by others. First"
" 	I love the Sleep No More experience and would highly recommend it to everyone. The setting is outstanding"
" 	Let me just say that I read a lot of reviews AFTER I had bought the ticket. And I was hesitant. Here is my experience: I went to the : show on Friday night and arrived promptly at : to no line. They quickly showed up however. We waited in the lounge area for a few minutes and the 'Spades' were called in. I read all of the tips about finding scenes and even read about the scenes"
" 	It can not be described by words. This is a MUST see! Something incredible"
" 	The best experiance I had in NYC! I've been to the city many times and thought I couldnt be surprised but Sleep no more is by far the craziest"

" 	My husband and I experienced Sleep No More in October  for the first time. We each had private interactions with actors and were blown away by everything. On our second visit in January"
" 	If you enjoy theater and hide and seek this is the perfect combination. Go with a good pair of shoes"
" 	""In near darkness"
" 	Having been to the Drowned Man in London I thought I was prepared for this production but I had a totally different experience. Yes"
" 	Its the best show I've watched till date. Full marks for uniqueness and the execution is just at another level all together. Leaves you simply stunned by the details that the show goes into. Easily the best show to watch in NYC.			Sleep No More	Surreal!	Anup	--	"
" 	""I attended this show with my girlfriend not knowing what to expect. We signed in like we were in a real hotel"
" 	This was my second visit to the hotel. It was a different"
" 	Previous reviews (good and bad) all accurate. The strangest 'theatre' production - the bar was really cool and the restaurant cabins (we were in the main restaurant) also looked good. Then for the rest of the experience we were based in a twenties/thirties style jazz bar which was also great. The main singer was Miss Stella Sinclair and she sang WELL and gave a great a performance along with her bac band. As for the 'theatre' performance"
" 	My sister and I went to see this and did not want to be separated but that is exactly what happened. The first time the elevator opened and we thought we were all getting off they tricked my sister and left her on the first floor we came on. She was the first one off the elevator and they wouldn't let the rest of us off so she walked into a dark room all by herself until a woman creeped from the darkness and led her to a different floor with other spectators. The first scene I came to was a woman bathing. There was lots of nudity"
" 	I had a great time! I guess it's best if you know Shakespeare's Macbeth. Even if you don't you may be able to appreciate the show. It's a different thing to see. The space is big so you can wonder around. Will try to go see it again since one cannot see everything at once"
" 	Ok.. This is hard to explain.. I won't give anything away. This is one of the best theatrical emulsive experiences I've ever encountered. I strongly suggest boo the earliest time slot to check in that you can.. The show is  hours long"
" 	Who ever invented this concept is a genius! The experience is unique and amazing. A person goes through an experience by him self"

" 	This was recommended to me by a friend. I took my parents who are in their mid sixties and very wary of anything labelled 'interactive' or 'immersive'. They went at a slower pace"

" 	I have a number of Punchdrunk and immersive productions under my belt and tcomparatively this was a cynical exercise in profit-ma. Everything came with a fee"
" 	All of us love the experience. I would reccomend it but would also warn about the very expensive drinks and how there is literally a velvet rope separating the very small bar area so that only VIPs can sit down and enjoy the musical performances after the show. At the price they charge for the tickets you would think the drinks would be affordable.. We did really enjoy the show though"
" 	My partner and I got tickets to see Sleep No More for Christmas. I was apprehensive at first because I truly didn't know what to expect-- however"
" 	I know this is an expensive experience but it is definitely worth it. We booked it for pm and had dinner next door before hand which was incredible.  The only thing I would say its intense and gets very warm... running around the rooms and following people up and down the stairs. So hydrate before hand.  The bathrooms are hard to find but they do exist in the actual theatre experience. The actors were incredible!			Sleep No More	AMAZING	Elena R	--	"
" 	This was booked as a surprise birthday present. I was unsure of what to expect. The person who invite me had seen it before and was trying to fill me in as we went along.. I enjoyed every minute of it and is planning on returning soon. Because of my lack of knowledge I missed some great parts of production. Can't wait to return worth the $$.. A must see...

" 	Mystery is a huge part of this experience. So without saying too much: I'm an artist and used to see the theatrical performances from a professional point of view (which often hinders the pleasure of experience). In this case I forgot about everything"
" 	It's officially been  months since I saw Sleep No More and I still can't stop raving about it. It is the most unique and immersive theater experience that is unlike anything you've ever experienced. Interactive theater and the story of Sleep No more definitely didn't disappoint! I would definitely recommend wearing comfortable shoes and be prepared to run around after the actors in order to see their full stories.  One of a kind experience!

" 	Let out on the top floor to find I was the only person wandering around the 'winter forest'.. okay no biggie but I would have liked to have seen some of the play in action. Embraced the 'darkness' and made my way through the various rooms ta in the ambiance. I saw no actors until I made my way down two more floors where Macbeth and his partner were embraced in a dance. Watching quietly Macbeth decided it was time to move through the room and basically pushed out of the way by my throat. All I could do was try and gain my composure and try not to make coughing and spluttering sounds in the enforced silence. It was after that that I made my way back down to the bar for a drink. Disappointing.			Sleep No More	Five stars if I wasn't throat punched by Macbeth.....	ElizaMarkert	--	"
" 	""Four stars for the production but only one star for the pre-performance happy hour at the Manderley Bar.  Felt like a bait and switch to us.

It was thrilling and sexy and weird all at the same time. The set was intense and perfectly executed. There is no way to describe this experience correctly. You have to check it out for yourself.

" 	""Overall disappointing. The cocktails at the onset were the highlight. We initially were guided onto an elevator"
" 	overall a very interesting and different 'show' to see. I was dubious at first but went with friends who had been before and was given the best advice..... Don't worry about being split up from the people you are with... Walk around lots....take it all in... If you want to follow someone... Do... But if you don't get the urge.... Just carry on investigating rooms until your instinct tells you to stop. By being like this I felt at ease to just do what I wanted. I saw lots. Interacted with the characters.... Some bits I saw were really crowded and in some rooms it was only me and a few others. After me and the group I was with met up at the end... We had all seen totally different things apart from a couple of 'big' scenes. It was very cleverly managed and I would definitely go again just to see what else I can find.

" 	This was my one play I was getting to see in NYC and had some pretty high expectations due to my daughter's critique of the production. There were some very entertaining parts and I love traveling around the old hotel to see the different segments. The actors were talented and very professional but I felt like it was way too crowded.....too many tickets were sold. It was also too short. Just as I was finding my way around we were herded back into the extremely crowded bar area where the music was way too loud. The torch singer had a nice voice but the amp was turned up to teeth jarring decibals. All in all I was disappointed with my experience and felt it was too expensive for this production.

They said they had been three times and had had three different experiences and would go again in a second. I did a quick google search and was sold on the audience members wearing the weird masks alone. We went into the experience not knowing a ton about it (our friends didn't want to ruin anything for us). We knew it was based somewhat on Shakespeare's Macbeth (which neither of us remembered a lot about and didn't brush up on before we went) but that it is set in a more modern time with a bit of a Hitchcock twist. We also knew the general concept that you are free to roam a  story hotel made up of interesting set pieces and may run into performances by actors at any time. Nearly  hours later we bought the $ program/book and left feeling like we would love to go back again. In fact"

An incredibly different theatrical experience where you tap into your voyeuristic side.Loo for a new thrill or something completely different you have to check out Sleep No More in Chelsea the next time you're in Manhattan! Some of the cons--The $ mandatory bag check bc the line to get your bag/ coat after the show is over gets incredibly long so ladies leave the purses home. Also it got pretty hot inside the place.

" 	""This """"show"""" is supposed to feel like you're in the 's but the people look like they are dressed for a vampirish freak show; some employees speak with an english accent and call you """"darling"""" which is a little annoying.

I had no idea what to expect. They had previously seen this theater group in London. First - you must go for a pre-drink to the Green Gallows rooftop bar. It's amazing. So cool.

" 	""This is an """"interactive"""" performance set inside of a hotel. It's a bit spooky at first but that goes away quickly. There is zero dialogue from either the guests or the actors. It lacks cohesiveness; it makes no sense whatsoever. After the initial interest of po around rooms and following characters it gets boring because nothing really happens. I read great reviews about this show and was intrigued; loo forward to experiencing something different. I must say I am  years old and most of the other guests were much younger. Perhaps they find this type of performance more entertaining.""			Sleep No More	Disappointing	Liz G	--	"
" 	I think Sleep No More is one of those things that people are scared to say they didn???t like or get because everyone else says it???s amazing. It was terrible.  If you don???t have dinner reservations you can still grab an overpriced drink at the bar first. The bar is okay except I smelled like a fog machine the rest of the night. When they call your number you are led in to a hotel and told you can wonder around. That???s it. No background story not instruction nothing. Just here is a mask (which I think is worn so you can???t tell how confused everybody is) and here is a staircase. Then you just wonder around. You have no idea who the characters are. You are told you are in a hotel but there are medical notes"

" 	""Let me start by saying"
" 	It was extremely crowded. Content was terrible"
" 	Booked tickets for a girls' weekend trip to NYC. We arrived with expectations of a fantastic evening and the McKitterick hotel delivered in every way! We split up immediately upon entering the show and each had our own personal experiences that we shared over post-show pizza and wine on the Gallow Green rooftop.

" 	This show is not for everyone. You need to be open minded"
" 	""My granddaughter and I attended this play for a brief time. We were aware that it was different in that there was no dialogue and that you had to be silent and wear a mask. There was no mention that it was completely dark and somewhat """"smoky"""". I don't know if this was to create a certain ambiance or to hide the fact that this was the worst performance either of us has almost attended. We both felt the need to get out of the hotel as quickly as possible. Even that was difficult in the dark. My granddaughter bemoaned that we were wasting my money by leaving. I told her I would pay the same amount just to get out!!!""			Sleep No More	misleading	Michaele G	--	"

" 	This is my second time seeing this show. I saw it three years ago. It was still just as fun. I love following the actors around the space! Though it is hard to follow the same person sometimes as it can get crowded. I saw many different scenes and explored the letters and documents in the rooms. My friend and I shared our experiences afterwards and we tried to weave the pieces of each characters story. You could go back multiple times and see it different each time as there are so many actors. There is something very personal about this experience while wearing a mask because you feel anonymous. The actors are incredible and manage to stay in character despite the obstac of people all around them. I love that you can experience this show any way you want. You could sit down and relax on a chair and take a break"
" 	Although I found it slightly confusing at first this is a fabulous interactive theatre experience that I could easily attend several times and have a different experience each time I accompanied my daughter and didn't see her for the whole night"

" 	Before leaving Australia for NYC It was recommended that I go to Sleep No More which is a different and unique theatrical experience. I took my daughter and it was exactly that. As part of the audience you are free to roam around the hotel going from room to room watching the scenes and actors playing them.  It's Macbeth with a twist of Lemon!  Don't read too much into the 'stuff' in each room. There are no secret clues as these are just props.  You'll never experience anything quite like this. Some will love it others will loathe it.  Lots and lots of staircases. Be prepared to move quickly as you won't be in the one room for long.  Read about it on their web/blog page if you are anxious to get the low down and enjoy.

The actors are great and their timing during the play is perfect. Just make sure you wear comfortable shoes and join a gym before thin in watching this play (not kidding!!).

" 	Local friends told us about this show. You make your own experience. Everyone in masks and going through a maze of different rooms watching the performers tell an interesting story. Don't be afraid to interact with the props in rooms and respond to the actors if they interact with you. It is not scary as it could sound (some rooms are spooky and dark but fear is not a driving force within the play). Would recommend having some drinks before to loosen up! Is costly but worth it if you're an adult loo for a different type of adventure. 			Sleep No More	Not your ordinary NYC show	Lucinda M	--	"

It is one of the best things to see/do in New York. Highly recommended.			Sleep No More	Unforgettable immersive theatre night out in Manhattan	Happytravellerabc	--	"
" 	Choose your own adventure type of show. No need to wear nice clothes. Certainly advise wearing sneakers as you will be scurrying up and down a -story building to follow the various actors. Upon arrival go downstairs to the main ballroom which is where most of the characters will convene. The ferocious dancing by several of the male characters is quite amusing. Just be mindful some of the actors will want you to interact with them"

I also got angry at the beginning - we stood out in the cold for more than  minutes and than they charged us $ per person for the bag - that they don't alloud inside. If you forbit people coming in with bags you should say that in advance or don't charge extra for it (they could take extra  $ for a ticket and I woudent notice ) It's a pity because it's interesting and I think I could enjoy more.

" 	Sleep No More was fantastic! My boyfriend heard about it from a podcast he listens to and I didn't think much of it (It could have been his horrible description of what the night entails to be honest) but bought us tickets anyway because he really wanted to do it. I still wasn't that excited but then lining up for the 'hotel' entrance and then getting our 'room keys'"
" 	A local friend took myself plus some friends to see this show last week and we've been raving about it to everyone ever since. It's such an immersive experience and has serious repeatability factor.  I'd recommend doing this in small groups as it's difficult to keep track of everyone the entire time. Also you'd do well to brush up on your Macbeth"
" 	""This was my second time going to Sleep No More and I can't get enough. It is so unique"
" 	No argue that the production is amazing. The place is designed and decorated VERY meticulously and it's a truly unique experience to go through. However"
" 	Immersive theater they call it"
" 	Its pretty cool. nothing scary or sexual happened (apart from you see some graphic acting etc) but nothing bad happens to you - its just a play that occurs around you which you interact with by wal through rooms where different acts are silently and artistically carried out.

" 	Sleep No More is an immersive play in which you wander the massive set and jump from story to story. This play is not your usual piece of linear story telling. The beautiful thing about this experience is the freedom to follow a set of actors through their role and through the different stages. I personally enjoyed wandering through the stages and discovering little side rooms that were barely used. The amount of detail put in to the set is astonishing.

" 	This one was of the finest experiences I had in New York. I've been living in this city for a while but it wasn't until a friend of mine paid me a visit that I decided to come to this place. What an amazing experience! Since the moment you enter to hotel everybody and everything is on character. You check in to the hotel and walk kind of a blackened pass way to the lobby where you can have some drinks. When you check in they give you a poker card and when you are at the lobby they call your poker card. Most likely you will be separated from your friends or partners but chances are you find them inside at some point. Once you are in the hotel"

" 	My first experience of immersive theatre and one i really did enjoy. A great set and brilliant performers. I'm not sure i actually understood the story but i love the place. The atmosphere in the bar was great as was the music which went on late into the night. I enjoyed the last scene.  It was very hot despite it being february.  Get there as early as possible and start exploring! I walked a lot during the evening. It's a bit of a walk from the nearest subway. I found it difficult to get a cab afterwards (and didnt have data so couldnt uber) so ended up with a long walk late at night back to my hotel.  I thought it was a little expensive.

" 	Sleep No More is pure artistic self-gratification and I would not recommend it to anyone uns they like indulgent 'artsy' theatre. The sets were impressive"
" 	The McKittrick Hotel staff managed to preserve the mystery and atmosphere of this absolutely bizarre performance right from the moment you first register to attend"
" 	""First I should preface that my boyfriend and I are in our early 's. We noted that there were a lot of younger people at this show and"
" 	""This is an interesting experience and I would recommend doing it at least once. It's an """"immersive play"""" set in a -story building where actors run around various rooms in the building (supposed to be McKittrick Hotel) and pantomime and dance various scenes (actors don't talk). All spectators follow the actors from room to room (different actors take different routes through the building) and try to make sense of what's going on. All spectators wear white masks (you get to keep them) and are not supposed to speak to each other or to the actors.  The performance takes  hours (e.g. pm-pm). There are three -hour """"loops"""" in each -hour performance when actors do the same thing. Because there are many actors and many rooms in the building and because action happens in different rooms (most of the time)"

I can enjoy a dance scene for it's beauty but this was supposed to tell a story. I didn't not get the story. I was told that it was the story of Macbeth. BUT I didn't see it. I didn't even see a main character. And when people kept telling me """"oh you will love it and everyone has their own and different experience"""" ..... they at least got the second half of that correct. If it's suppose to be a story how can we all have a different experience? It would be like everyone going to see Titanic but the ship doesn't sink for everyone? It's seemed more like Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios but without people jumping out at you than theater.  I wandered around for a few hours and just enjoyed it for a beautiful abandoned movie set while droves of tourists ran past me chasing a random actor.

" 	This should be enjoyable no matter but the better prepared you are the more fun you'll have. I'm familiar enough with Macbeth but not Rebecca and followed most of the scenes I encountered just fine but can see where they could have meant a lot more to me. I was apprehensive about being separated from my party but was at ease with that soon enough as there were multiple staff throughout the attraction.The actors all stuck fiercely to their duties and before long I too was drawn in and transported for the next few hours. Sometimes I just flat out couldn't keep up when trying to follow a character as I wasn't willing to run etc. after getting my toes stepped on by oncoming traffic more than once. You can definitely get a good workout in with all the stairs and square footage there is to cover and it is necessary if you have a hope of feeling like you saw enough of it. I'm not sure fortune favors the bold as much as it does the young and fit but I think you could have a perfectly fine time strolling at your leisure too. Tip though"

" 	There really is no other live performance experience like Sleep No More. This review has no spoilers because going in without a clue is part of the fun. Essentially you are in an interactive performance piece and exploring a huge building that is wondrously designed and fabricated. I took my wife for her birthday and she was mesmerized. I would say get a table in the bar if you can before and/or after the show. The band is also amazing. Make sure to wear comfortable wal shoes and be prepared to walk/stand for  hours.

" 	My partner and I attended Sleep No More as guests of Maximilian. We were given priority entry and had a reserved table in the bar. From the moment we walked in we were completely immersed.

We both had one on one experiences with the actors which added to the excitement of the performance. Sleep No More is so well executed"

" 	With the amount of people let in we spent most of the time being pushed. The crowed is guided to follow actors they find interesting as the actors go from room to room and perform their next scene"
" 	Sleep No More is an immersive theater experience where participants walk through dark hallways and dimly lit rooms to explore the space"
" 	no doubt the actors were very talented but its a dark play in a very dark set and there are scenes scattered all over the  or so floors which is very well done giving you a real sense of been part of the play however as other reviewers mentioned some patrons literally run after the actors like the paparazzi chasing a film star so in some cases a crowd was running through the sets"

" 	We went to the PM show on Friday night with no expectations other than it being an interactive theater show about MacBeth. It definitely would have helped if we researched online before going. The show is set in the old McKittrick Hotel and on each of the  floors a story is being told (there is a th floor although you are not allowed uns one of the actors brings you there). From the moment you get there you are taken to another place and time. You are given a white mask to wear and told there is no tal allowed and then taken to an elevator that drops you off on one of the floors where you're on your own to explore and experience each and every room. The entire show is basically in the dark with only low light spotlights to mark your way. Be sure to take in everything you see and hear and try to follow one of the characters as you go from room to room. They encourage you to touch"

" 	I did research and was expecting an amazing event but did not experience one.  If you like silent movies this maybe for you but it did not hold our interest (our ages  &  and  & ).  Too hot even in February and too many theater goers. Very difficult to keep up with following one character up and down  floors to stop and watch a silent ballet type scene here and there with - other people all pushing to gain a view of the scene.  I???d rather an introduction and story line"
" 	The concept for this type of theatre is so cool and interesting. The execution is horrible. It took me - minutes before even finding an actor. Once I did I was plowed over by people literally running to keep up with an actor.  Once in a room alone and two actors came in. Soon the room was filled and my front row view soon became th as people anonymously masked had no problem pushing me out of the way.  I had no idea what was going on"

Listed below are all the problems I had with it along with all the good """"required coat check that we pay for"""" -the first problem I had was the fact that its required to check your coat and purse but they charge you for it. The tickets were a gift and I went the same day I was given the tickets so I didn't go on the website before hand. I understand its required which is fine but don't charge people for it. There lucky I had cash on me because I honestly never do. I ask the guy why we had to pay if its required and he said he didn't know why and he gets asked that a lot.  """"Took my purse"

" 	We had been loo forward to this show for a very long time and was a first priority for our trip to New York. This brilliant concept and show was completely ruined by huge numbers from an overseas tour group from a country which has no understanding of space and personal enjoyment. Instead of allowing everyone to appreciate space they stampeded from place to place barging into people and crowding the actors and other patrons. The theatre should have intervened either during the performance or by ensuring there was appropriate advice given beforehand about how to behave in an interactive theatre.

" 	Wasn't sure what I was signed up for but was excited to see this show. You follow characters around a hotel silently where they perform and you try to keep up with the story as they sing and dance.

The production value and talent of the performers is amazing. Even the performers with smaller ro really gave it their all. Every single person on that stage was in full character and totally committed to their part. There are times when you can see people 'on the sidelines' of the stage while someone else is performing their solo. They never broke character and were all about ma that scene the best it could be. The orchestra for this musical is stage center. They are on display the entire time and it was great to see that. They performed every song flawsly and even had some parts where they were part of the play. The main characters"

The show was entertaining and the female costumes eye catching being a better option than the   from a male perspective. The music was also well performed and quite entertaining. Be aware of the ticket prices as we were quoted two different prices quoted within an hour at the box office. We sat in front row of the rear mezzanine to the right and had an excelent view for $ a ticket. We were originally quoted $-$ a ticket and having had a think went back and were then quoted $-$.

The rest of the cast members are just fantastic. Such energy. The voices! They all sing incredibly well. Maybe that's why Billy Ray Cyrus does not fit in. This is not his genre at all.

" 	Saw it //. I am Hungarian so them tal pig Latin instead of Hungarian was annoying and indicated to me that they did not put very much effort and research into the performance. The set was simple. Stage was small and old. I have yet to see a Broadway performance that has / as much in it as most Vegas shows. The performers were for the most part good"
" 	We were expecting a big theatrical production just as jam packed as the movie but were left disappointed. Don't get me wrong the singing and dancing on display as fantastic and an example of why the shoe has lasted so long but for our first broadway show we really had higher hops. The big band took up most of the stage and actually stayed there the whole time leaving little room for much else. The old theatre it is in has one tiny snacks bar. Although soft drinks are re-fillable though I can't see too many people wanting to get up and re-fill their drink during the show...  Personally I'd like to see a new Velma Kelly. Having someone portray her with pixie cut bleach blonde hair when they had the girl playing Roxie with a short black Velma like bob was a bit distracting and confusing.			 the Musical	Disappointing	InMelbWeTrust	--	"

" 	It is well performed. The artists sing and dance and the orchestra have for the change of order got a well deserved place ON scene instead of in the ditch. That said - the show is minimalistic when it comes to scenes and settings. Some chairs moves around but besides that - nothing. The dancing are the focus of the show and there is a story that sticks together - not just random songs loosely tied together. That said - there are better musicals to pick from if you're not totaly into the dancing part. As usual: No cameras allowed in the theatre according to their written ru. In reality"

I was expecting a little more razzle dazzle however they stayed in the same all black attire - but it was probably the way Fosse wanted it. But man those women are strong and they performed their butts off! Beautiful vocals"

" 	Very entertaining. Rumer Willis played Roxie and was excellent. The role of the lawyer and husband of Roxie also performed well and were crowd favorites. The music and dancing were superb.

" 	My partner and I travelled all the way from the UK and I was so excited about seeing the show! However I was sorely disappointed. The stage stayed the same throughout and no costumes changed either. It was so dull I couldn't wait for it to end. I was furious as we paid a fortune for the ticket. Rumer was the only positive. Unfortunately the other main lead couldn't keep up and I think it's time another velma was recruited. Save your money!			 the Musical	Poor show. No razzle dazzle.	ssouthampton	--	"

" 	Absolutely fabulous!! Particularly Mama Morton and Roxy - Rumer Willis has a great voice and really fits the part well. Nice historic theatre but the toilet situation needs to be fixed. The queue was huge and some people missed the start of the second act. Expensive refreshments as you would expect. The seating plan can be quite confusing.

" 	We had front row seats on the Mezzanine level. My neighbor had given me some  glasses and I didn't need them. Bought tickets several months in advance on the internet. ($ plus fees equaling $ and change. Did not want to take a chance at the discount TKTS h and I was very glad. Hundreds of people in line there and my seats more than likely wouldn't have been as good. The play blew us away. Highly recommended with a easy walk from Times Square. 			 the Musical	Wow !!!!!!!

The theatre was full with people of all ages.  I never thought I'd see a show on Broadway but wanted to spoil my wife. The performers were mesmerising. The music was performed beautifully by the live band and the venue was comfortable. Word of warning.  wines and a kit Kat cost $. if you buy them in theatre .  Thoroughly enjoyable "

" 	We attended the night of Rumer Willis' nd performance. She was surprisingly good. The show as a whole"
" 	Amazing amazing amazing!!! Gripping from the onset. This legendary Broadway show will captivate you right from the start. Thoroughly entertaining. There is some profanity but nothing too bad. I would say try to be seated downstairs as upstairs is definitely more of a birds eye view. The seating is unfortunately uncomfortable. The seats small and legroom are is a no no if you are taller than ft. Always opt for an aisle. I'm ft  and managed ok in an aisle. No wonder it's the longest running musical on Broadway"
" 	We thought we would see Rumer Willis in her second night as Roxy but she was delayed starting. The sub was a veteran of the show who looks a bit like Nicole Kidman and was terrific just the same. We got discounted tickets through NYTix and sat in the front row for $ a seat including taxes and fees. What a treat! We love getting to make eye contact with the performers and showing our appreciation. The orchestra is outstanding - they love what they are doing and it shows. They even integrate the maestro into the show at times. Go see this show before it finishes its run!			 the Musical	Wonderful"
" 	Must say the show was brilliant and we had front row seats. Quite novel how the orchestra was on stage and formed part of the set.The actors and actresses sat at side of stage. The dancing and singing was brilliant with a well balanced and talented staff..The theatre is quite unique and we found it a problem using the toliets at the intervals.

" 	Coming from Aus..this was a must do for us and I was incredibly pleased and delighted to experience this show in NY city. Definitely an occasion we will always remember..the theatre..now that was pretty disappointing. We had a relatively good view but I personally think it should be a mandatory rule that women can't put their hair up! Boofy hair spoils it for people behind.. There was a little girl three seats down having a very difficult time of it to which I felt very sorry for her. Swapping seats with other family members didn't seem to matter unfortunately as three women in the row in front all had their hair up. My other big big problem was the bathroom situation...a gazil women and not that many toilets to accommodate them! I missed the first  minutes at least after intermission and had stood in line the entire time. The production itself was outstanding so although the there are some nigg I'm giving  stars because the show is what I'm reviewing"
" 	If you love the movie you will love the show.. the talent was incredible not a bad seat in the house. the fellow who plays her husband is perfect for the part . the place is older but clean well managed and the ushers really are awesome.. the vendors walk around with  dollar snacks avarage price for such things at shows cash only.. there is a  min intermission or so bathrooms are up stairs but they do have a handicaped down stairs for people with special needs.. got there  minutes to show time and we had perfect seats  rows back and right in the center.. we were there for a : show and it was a wed so we saved a little off the show price.. full but you dont feel crowed.. all the dance numbers are great. can see why its lasted this long.			 the Musical	best choice for musical	jimmysgirl	--	"

We got to the theatre half an hour early which meant we were in the queue but not too far back. We got in pretty quickly and were shown to our seats very easily. The seats were good and very central for the price we paid. I would suggest to try and get isle seats if you are tall as being an old theatre the room between your seat and the seat in front is not huge and as a man of ft  I couldn't feel my knees after the first  minutes.

" 	Excellent production - full of energy"
" 	We stayed at a hotel literally  doors down from the theater. It was  degrees on a Sunday and we were loo for indoor things to do in NYC. We left our hotel and there was a line in front of the Ambassador Theatre. We inquired about it and were told they start selling $ tickets at noon for the : show. We got in line! Within  minutes"
" 	I knew the songs"
" 	I waited  years to see this play and I was not disappointed. My mother and I went into the city on a Friday and went to Time Square to get discounted tickets at the h. We weren't able to sit together but we got the tickets! It turns out that we were also there for Mel B's (Spice Girl) last performance. She was great but so was everybody else. Some of the dancers were fantastically talented too. I really enjoyed the show and how it combined satire with morbid humor. I also liked the way they integrated the orchestra into the show as on-again off-again secondary characters. Side Note: The people sitting next to me brought their young (age  and ish) kids which was kind of weird. This isn't one of the Broadway shows that I would consider to be Family-friendly. It was written during the Great Depression"
" 	What an experience to go to a show at the Ambassador on Broadway. Unbelievably cool. And to pick  was a great choice. Funny"
" 	As expected of a musical the singers were amazing. However the show was rather boring and I did not enjoy the cheap comedy that they had added. I was suppose to be a funny show"
" 	Bought tickets from the same day ticket h on Times Square. The tickets cost us approx ?? each. Great show"
" 	Cast on the top of their game. Fantastic feel good show. Superb acting"

" 	I must admit I didn't know the story of  before I booked this. We booked through the TKTs h at Times Square. I'm so glad we chose this musical!  It was fantastic. love that it had an orchestra you could see playing and they incorporated the musicians into the show. It was humorous and fun to watch. The singers and dancers were all great.

" 	Mel B enjoyed her delivery as much as we enjoyed watching. only disappointment was an unimaginative and never changing set ... guess they had to find an innovative way of fitting the band in ..... who by the way were superb. if choosing a Broadway show you can't go wrong with this one 			 the Musical	thoroughly enjoyable 	jonrons	--	"

" 	Absolutely love the film so thought the show would be even better but unfortunately it wasn't. Although the actresses were very good"
" 	The two and a half hours went by so fast with the awesome actors and orchestra! I absolutely love Roxie Hart"
" 	I had higher expectations. The first half of the show was a bit boring. Second half was better. I would have preferred more dancing and singing. The story line was ok. Although I felt it could have been better if the actors were stronger. They never grabbed my attention except for the gentleman who played the husband. He grabbed my attention immediately and for most of the audience. He received the loudest applause. I was pretty bummed. I was super excited about this venue. I recommend sitting in Orchestra seating. These are floor seats. I was sitting in balcony front row on Mezzanine level. It was too high. Theatre is small but nice. Only downfall"
" 	Having heard about this fun show I was happy that our travel club had arranged for us to have excellent seats for a matinee. The actors were fabulous and the orchestra was spot on. It was an entertaining and engaging  / hour performance that I thoroughly enjoyed. Before you go see it"
" 	""The show was okay. Not great. Not terrible. The show itself is  stars. The nearly  year old theater"
" 	Dated. Lists. Almost boring. Annoying orchestra placement on stage causes the muted trumpet and trombones to pierce through the ears of the orchestra seating first ten rows. Very distracting. Mel B (Scary Spice girl) is much better than expected. On // pm performance Jason Patrick Sands played Billy Flynn and unfortunately lacked the snap and enthusiasm of the regular lead"
" 	I paid an obscene amount of money to see a show that was so minimalist it didn't merit being called a broadway production. The chorus performers were excellent but the two leads were weak. The actress playing Velma was  years old. Now"

" 	We booked this show thin this would be a real show stopper what we got was a low budget regular show we could have seen anywhere. Veronica dunne who played Roxy was sickly sweet and not at all the hard edged actress that you would expect in this role.The stage was tiny and the orchestra who I have to say were the only good thing about this show took up two thirds of it leaving little room for the performance.

" 	I have to admit"
" 	No matter who the leading ladies are"
" 	I just came back from NYC and I saw this musical on the Sep.  is my favourite musical and my expectations were high. The stage setting is the biggest turn off. The orchestra fill almost the entire stage so there is just a few meters for the crew to perform. The stage setting and wardrobe look very poor. I think a musical like  deserves a better production with wow effects"
" 	The first thing I was impressed with was the theater itself"
" 	I've seen many shows"
" 	Did not pre-purchase tickets before we arrived in New York as we heard that a place in Times Square sold them cheaper. That was no understatement. Tkts sold us the tickets for . each (s than half price) - only condition is that the tickets you purchase are for that nights show only. We were surprised that our seats were in the second row.

" 	I have just visited from the UK with my family and we went to see this show. We got our tickets from TKTS - half price. One tip - ask the agent for the best seats they can offer and where they are as we were told we were  rows back in the orchestra which was true but it was the back row - the seats were fine but we felt like this could have been made clearer. This is the th time I have seen  and this was by far the best. The cast were excellent - Roxie a delight with her comedic talent. Velma a fabulous performer with a powerful voice. All other cast members were slick and energetic - Billy Flynn reminded me of Mr Big! Yes the set is minimal and not as elaborate as some shows but the performers and great songs give this show its razzle dazzle! 			 the Musical	Great Show	TravellingRita	--	"

" 	Despite the talent of many of the performers"
" 	""I took my daughter to see   years ago. It was wonderful! The production I saw last week with my son does not compare. It was so"
" 	Great performances by all. One of the only shows I've felt that the cast is connecting intimately with the audience. We got our great mezzanine seats for half price at TKTS so good value (and lots of empty seats so definitely get your tickets there). Only negative was the depressing set. There really was no set. Just the orchestra. I enjoy a show that spends some attention on the set and the costumes. It was an upbeat show and not nearly as dark as the movie. Very appropriate for kids. 			 the Musical	Kudos to the cast	Doris C	--	"

" 	Very disappointed in this play. The orchestra was on stage"
" 	I came to see  on my recent trip to New York. I was surprised at how close ( rows from the stage) I was sat as I thought I had booked the cheapest tickets. The show was fabulous. It has a different vibe from the film (which is where I feel some of these negative reviews are coming from.) The staging was great as the idea of the play is that it is like being in a jazz club. The actors had great voices and were great dancers. It's obviously expensive to buy drinks and snacks. I went to the bar and asked for a coke it cost $ but came in a special  cup. (Think it might've been cheaper if I had specified that I didn't want the cup.) All staff at the theatre were really friendly and created a great atmosphere. They queue you up outside before going in so prepare for the weather. I waited outside by the stage door to see the stars of the show leave. The actor who played Amos was really friendly.

" 	Another great show to watch in New York"
" 	The orchestra was centre stage in this show which was a real distraction also characters that had no part in what was going on sitting at the sides of the staqe. No sets"
" 	Maybe it was because we had just seen Shuffle Along the night before"

The acting and singing were both outstanding and moving in parts. The show itself ticked every box in terms of feeling and emotion...there were sad and funny parts but mostly high drama and anticipation leaving you on the edge of your seat. I've seen this show twice now....London and New York....I cannot wait to see it again as it is one of my favourites. Would highly recommend seeing a show on Broadway"
" 	I'm not writing this review because I'm angry about wasting time and money"
" 	After seeing the movie I was so excited to see the musical especially as my first broadway experience. While I enjoyed the humour and the show generally I was expecting so much more from broadway. I felt it lacked that amazement and spectacular aspect that I was expecting from broadway. The cast were great and performed well but the show itself didn't wow me.  A good show to see but probably not worth the near $ I spent on it. There are definitely better shows to see on Broadway.			 the Musical	Was expecting more	annachapple	--	"

" 	Saw  last night on Broadway. It was the worst Broadway show we have ever seen. The cast did not connect with the audience"
" 	o This was my first time in a musical and I was really impressed by the level of the choreographies"
" 	We couldn't hear the singers over the orchestra. We were sitting in the front row of the first balcony so maybe the sound was better on the main floor. We asked one of the ushers to pass on our concern to the sound guys and they did change the mix somewhat but we still missed a lot of the dialogue when the orchestra was playing. We didn't expect poor sound quality at a Broadway show.			 the Musical	Disappointed	Duncan_Lori	--	"
" 	This was the worst production of anything we've ever seen including high-school.  We had no idea what the story line was because we couldn't hear what they were singing - and that's just the start. I didn't imagine they a Broadway show could be so bad and survive. The best bit was leaving at half-time and going for a drink instead.  Very poor form. I felt sorry for the performers who must know it's not what it should be. 			 the Musical	There was an elephant in the toom	SydneyKoukla	--	"

" 	Really enjoyed the show"
" 	Really disappointed.. Have seen many shows before but this was my first on Broadway so I assumed it would be epic..wrong!! it was probably the worst production I've seen to date. The orchestra took up % of the stage leaving no room of decent choreography. Just chairs and singing. I think I could have got  friends together and done it in my house.. 			 the Musical	Low budget!!

" 	Music was good but some of the singers were very weak (or drowned out by the orchestra). Paid premium prices so had good seats and a good view. Had never seen this show before so did not know what to expect but it is a more 'lower budget' show compared to ones like   etc"
" 	Having heard so much about this show I decided that it would be worth a visit. I could not have been more disappointed. Everything about it was poor. The staging was perhaps the most ridiculous I have ever seen. Who thinks it is a good idea to have the orchestra take over most of the stage? However"
" 	""I have seen better high school performances. Did Eddie George pay to get that role. He is former NFL. He is not Broadway worthy. The lead female ro were played by old old actresses.

" 	Bought tickets online. Show acceptable but not great mainly because of some poor acting and borderline singing.

There is no foyer or nice place to hang around before the show. You enter and go to your seat. You can buy something at the bar or at the guy at the floor. It gave us the feeling more like a cinema. The space of your seat is very very very limited"

This is at best community theater in a retirement home. SAVE YOUR MONEY. I guess watch the movie if you want to see bits and pieces of how this was originally intended to be seen. This was an absolute bait and switch. Go see literally anything else. That includes off broadway. Really no costume changes? You can???t be bothered to add one light with some color?

" 	I was excited to see this Broadway musical because it???s a great soundtrack- but after seeing it"
" 	I have avoided seeing this show for years because I have always felt that a murder is not my idea of what a musical should be based on. I was in NY and I purchased a ticket.  I will leave any review of the actors and singers alone. This show gives them very little opportunity to show their talent. The storyline is weak. Costuming is weak. Sets are s than weak. I was told this was an omage to something but I have no idea what it was an omage to other than poor theater. I have seen high school productions that rival this performance. My ticket cost did not reflect what I was given. Stay Away.			 the Musical	 has been murdered	Peter G	--	"

" 	 was my first Broadway show and it did not disappoint! It was everything I expected and wanted: sexy"
" 	I was disappointed in the show. The theatre was very small leaving no leg room. The show itself seemed to be good but many scenes I couldn't understand what was being sung or said over the music that played and I sat right in the front mezzanine.

" 	My daughter and I had a night out in NYC together"
" 	Thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish. The Ambassador Theatre was smaller than i expected which was great is it meant our seats were very close to the stage. Unusual to see the orchestra actually on the stage as part of the show essentially & the conductress actually having an active spea part ! The lady who played Roxy was outstanding as were all the players to be honest from lead ro to the chorus and dancers were stunning. Hadn't seem  before"

" 	It was Thursday"
" 	Was our first Broadway experience and wanted to get something more with darker humor and happened upon  while visiting the ticketing website. Was able to see  as a movie way back when and thought it would be a good treat for our first Broadway show. Actors were fantastic although I would say they are further in age than the characters in the original show but the songs and acts were fantastic. The theater was rather small but the play used every part and every character to add some comedy on every step of the way. House was completely packed for the PM showing on a Sunday and just note there are no photos allowed and the price for food & drinks are ridiculous. Would recommend you to bring your own drinks (like water).			 the Musical	Fun and comedic show	Benson C	--	"

" 	My  year old daughter and I got tickets for this half off at TKTS. Fabulous singing and dancing; and nice to see the orchestra right on stage. I???m glad my  year old wasn???t with us as it was not appropriate for her. We ate at the Playwright Celtic Pub before hand and went to Justin???s for dessert after. Both are excellent.

" 	My teenage daughter is obsessed with the soundtrack so this was a must see for her when we decided on a girls' trip to NYC. I really enjoyed the show (I've seen the movie before) and the performers are all so talented. It's a low budget set with pretty much just chairs for props and the same costume throughout the show but the performance is top notch. I especially liked seeing the orchestra on stage and being part of the show.			 the Musical	Great Show	jkk	--	"

Powerful trumpets and trombones and the Tuba was good too. Singing was s powerful but good character development and the familiar numbers didn???t disappoint. There is no set to speak of"
" 	I have love  and was extremely impressed by this production. It was wonderful. Most of the staff including the concessions samen and souvenirs samen were very polite and friendly. The ushers however were not. Extremely rude and unfriendly. I understand that these people have a hard job to do. But explaining to someone ???oh you don???t speak English? Well your seats are obviously right here??ù is not appropriate. I tried to tell my usher that he was seating one person of the people I showed up with in the wrong seat"

" 	Roxie Hart was entertaining but that's it. The rest of the show was awful. Their stage setup is really bad. I don't like seeing the performers sitting in chairs along the side of the stage when they're doing nothing. And there were no costume changes!

I had seen the movie with Richard Gere and Queen Latifah and thoroughly enjoyed the present cast portrayal of the musical. My fifteen year old son love it and he is rather selective in his likes and dislikes. We did have one issue - the lady sitting in front of him had a rather large afro and so he was maneuvering left and right to see the show around her huge hairstyle. But hey "

" 	I have seen  the musical about  times in the uk both in the west and and on variouse uk tours with lots of different casts.i love  the musical normally.this was the worst production of the show i have ever seen.if i had never seen chigago before this would have put me off for life.i was visiting new york from england and on my first night i decided to go see  on my first night.wish i hadnt bothered.cost me about $ from tkts half price which was still way too expensive $ would have been a fair price.i had seen amra faye wright who plays velma kelly twice in uk.once in london and once on tour and she is still brilliant really held the show together.mel b wasnt bad even though im not a fan.what let the cast down most was the dancers especially the men.they looked about  and were far too old to be playing the ro in those skimpy outfits they didnt look good.the band were terrible.they had no enthusiasm and were not swaying about as much as they do in uk.i thought the american production would be better but how wrong can u be.it was stale.the people playing amos heart and billy flynn wernt very good either.mary sunshine was ok but the one one on the uk tour was the best ive ever seen(alan richardson)totally amazing.the only person in this broadway production that really stood out was Lavon Fisher-Wilson who was playing mama morton.she was really good well worth seeing.so my advice on this is dont bother go and see something else like  ."

If you are short in height it is better to choose mezzanine level since it has steeper seating. The theater is small in size so there is no bad seat in my opinion. The show was Bravissimo!!!. The casting was great and music makes you sing and dance in your seat. Get a glass of wine during intermission then you can have a toast and drink wine withl Four Seasons during second act. The theater sells drink in sippie cup with theater logo on it. It is a bit high in price but it is prices to join in the act (in your mind).			 	Fun fun fun!	Adventurenerd	--	"

" 	I thought the show was well done. I never knew how prolific Frankie Valli was. I recognized all of the songs and the performers were all excellent. It was basically a chronology of his life and all his accomplishments. The only negative was that I bought the tickets from one of the people selling tickets in Times Square. He was knowledgable and told me the pros and cons of the different shows. He indicated that he was selling at under face value but when I acutally received the tickets I paid over face value. I hate feeling like I was taken advantage of!!! 			 	Good show	brucekwg	--	"

" 	I am a life long Four Seasons fan. I saw them perform in person (the real guys) many times when I was a kid. I found   to be a great Broadway Show which tells the story of the band from the beginning in the 's and weave it in with excellent performances of many of their hit songs. Way back in the day we didn't know every single thing about the stars like they do today and I didn't know much about Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons the people.   is fun and entertaining and you learn quite a bit about the band's story.  We attended a Wednesday matinee just yesterday and it seemed to be packed. The seating was about the most roomy and comfortable I have ever found on broadway so that was a bonus.  Please not we were two minutes late (literally ) and the show had already started. I am not used to people being that on time! We had to stand in the back till there was a set change to get seated so be ON TIME! Enjoy!			 	Yo You Gotta See Dis	Streetfeeds	--	"

" 	Stupendous! I walked out of the theater and downloaded the album off iTunes immediately. And we're still singing the songs days after. The entire cast did a fantastic job but Jarrod Spector was just something else....the part where he sang My Eyes Adored.. you could hear a pin drop.  So so happy we managed to find tickets so last minute. We booked at mid-day for the pm show through their main website (http://www.info.com/broadway/)...it may be more expensive but you get to choose your seats.			 	Great songs of course and sang beautifully	Essie	--	"

" 	As part of our wedding anniversary celebration in NY we decided to book a show and we couldn't have chosen better. The Austin Wilson theatre is a little off the beaten track of the more mainstream Broadway theatres but that doesn't detract from its charm. The show itself is second to none with some great acting and songs and the story is a good mix of drama and comedy. Even though we could have seen this show in London I don't think there would have been the same audience participation/reaction to some of the 'one liners' as there were obviously a fair few people in the audience fom ''. If you are planning to go to NY make sure you include this in your list of 'to does'. We did a Saturday matinee which commences at pm and concludes at pm allowing plenty of time for a nice meal.

Every song & every act kept you wanting more. The only negative thing I could say is the profanity. I was totally surprised and caught off guard. I felt it was too frequent but definitely helped to set the tone of the show. The story of Frankie Valli and the four seasons is gritty and controversial .			 	My favorite musical to date	mgfive	--	"

" 	My wife and I went to the   matinee show on th May  and absolutely love the show. We went to the TKTS outlet under the grandstand in Times Square and paid $. each for our great seats a few hours before the performance. We went to see Motown  days later and paid $. and thought that show was average and the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre was average as well. The August Wilson Theatre is way better because the seats are more spacious and comfortable and the bar and restrooms are better. The actual show is way better as well			 	Fantastic Show love It	Mckinnons	--	"

" 	My husband and I stopped by the box office earlier afternoon to buy tickets for the show on the same night. We got a lot better deal than discount ticket they sell at the Time square and did not wait for a long time. My husband enjoyed it so much because he grow up listening these kind of music. I am bit younger so I thought it was just ok musical. Story line and music were good but I have seen lot better musical in NYC in the past. We get to see and took a picture with one of casts who played in   and they were seemed very nice  (friendly). Good musical to see in NYC comparing other choices of musical they offer. But do not spend over $ per ticket because I do not think it's worth spending that much to see this musical. 			 	Great music	Hiromi C	--	"
" 	Our first experience of a Broadway show. The standard was very high. It was nice to hear a natural American accent rather than a UK person trying to put on an American accent (as experienced in a recent UK show). The singing was top quality better than heard on the west end.			 	Wonderful show"

" 	This is a great show but not as impressive as the London production. The lead role would have been excellent had I not seen the London show previously. The lead actor in NYC is very good but not as close to the original sound. There were some ill fitting wigs which was a little sloppy as it is just concentration to details by the back stage staff. Overall"
" 	The play   is among our favourites!!! This is the first time we have seen it in New York and although it was actually a bit weaker than the ones we saw in Toronto Canada over the last two or three years"
" 	Went to the evening show on /. We love the show. Great music. Great cast. Nice Theatre but fair warning that the seats are a little tight. My knees were hitting the seat in front of me.

" 	Saw a Wednesday matinee performance with Dominic Spage as Frankie Valli. I am not a fan of musicals but was transformed by the story and by the music. These guys can sing and Dominic's voice is a wonder. I love it so much I took in a Saturday matinee and it was just as magical. Took me right back to the days when I used to listen to the Four Seasons on my transistor radio. It does a soul good to hear the sounds of one's younger days and to see such talent bring it alive. I would recommend   to anyone who appreciates a bit of nostalgia and wonderful voices and routines. Well done to a great cast. Thanks for the great moments.			 	Two times a charm	artlover	--	"

The set looked plain at the beginning but what they did with it throughout the show was fantastic. I love!!! the show and would go again. All seats seemed to have good views. We were higher up but had a great overview of the show. I'd prefer it to sitting very close. Very entertaining but I wouldn't recommend it for young children.

" 	This show was more painful than a root canal.  grown me who had good voices who should have been at a karaoke bar where you would have expected bad language and affordable beer. This would have made a wonderful documentary on A&E with real out take of the original group (who I bet never said the f word as much as this group did) It is very over rated"

" 	It was an interesting story about how Franki Valli and the Four Seasons evolved through the years. Well told with all their hits (and songs that didn't hit the tops of the charts too) and interpersonal conflicts behind the scenes. John LLoyd Young is outstanding in the role of Franki Valli. Our seats were just five back from the stage so we got to see the performance up close which was great. My husband felt the seats themselves"

" 	I spent $ for two tickets to this show for my anniversary. The show was amazing and the performers great!  With that said people in the audience were sweating within  minutes of the show. I got up to ask an older female usher who was wor stage left to turn up the ac. She told me to stop loitering in the rear of the theater and said I should sit in the last row where the ac worked better? Excuse me? Just another person who couldn't make it on broadway being rude to customers! Totally unprofessional! Other than that my wife and I enjoyed the show and the story of Frankie valli but after paying $ on tickets you think I could enjoy the show without sweating through my shirt!

" 	""My sister and our daughters had a fabulous time at  . The story was surprisingly engaging and everything from the set to the staging was as in sync as the Four Seasons themselves.

I went to the show with my wife and oldest daughter on a Saturday evening. The trip to NYC and the tickets to   were my daughter???s college graduation present.

Its a very small theater so buying tickets a little bit to the back would be fine (if u want to save some money). The sound system is pretty good and consistent too. There was a disruption during the show when they stopped mid song because the person playing frankie was not feeling well and had to stop. (Apparently not the first time coz it happened to my friend too before). Toilet queue was long so go early during the intermission or you will have to wait till the end of the show. After the show"

By chec back frequently we finally got an orchestra seet for $.. The were alot of empty seats last Sunday night and the ushhers offerd us the opportunity to move up closes if we wanted to. They blamed the snow storm on the no shows but who knows what the real reason was. My suggestion is to keep chec the prices because I am convinced that they try to get you to buy the more expensive seats first before releasing the cheaper seats. The show was excellent and I would recommend it.			 	I finally got a decently priced ticket!	hollebcfp	--	"

" 	The acting was excellent and the songs great. Of course tickets are expensive uns you line up at TDK for discounted tickets for the matinee or night of the show. You really can get super deals that way.			 	Musical	Jack E	--	"
" 	Second time to see this production and it was again amazing. The vocal range and vocal similarity to Franky Valli by the lead was phenomenal. If you only have time for one Broadway show"

" 	Having seen this show once before in London and then now on Broadway you can really see how much better the Broadway production is"
" 	This wasn't at all what I expected and I was wildly surprised at how exceptional all the performers were. I was a bit concerned since this show has been running for some time so it's clearly not the original cast. I've seen many clips and performances with the original cast"

" 	It was such a great show"
" 	""Let me begin by mentioning that much of this music was in the early 's so these were songs that my parents listened to (yet we all have heard of) and I was concerned that I might not enjoy the show because of the era. I am pleased to report that anyone will enjoy this show regards of the music preferences ! This story of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons wor their way to stardom from the streets of NJ is simply amazing. This is not a show for young teenagers on down to children as there is some foul language and sexual innuendo.   is simply a fun show with good acting and incredible singing. The show went just under  and a half hours and does include an intermission. A tip I'd like to mention is that you can walk up to the box office the """"day of"""" and get a better ticket deal... of course you risk the show being sold-out with no tickets available"

" 	  is a must see show for anyone who loves a true story told through great acting and great music ( it is about Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons if you are not familiar with the story). We had seen both the musical and the movie before and we definitely prefer the musical theatre production. The August Wilson Theatre on nd and Broadway is the location for the musical. It is a smaller theatre but it serves the show well and the acoustics were terrific! We sat in the middle of the center section  rows back on the mezzanine level since I had read that those seats had a great view and excellent sound and the advice was accurate. We totally enjoyed the whole experience and we applaud all the actors on an amazing job with vocals and acting! After the play"

" 	""  puts a smile on your face because you recognize most of the songs (you forget the amazing number of hits!). We had a substitute for the lead role of Frankie Valli but he was terrific. It is not the best broadway show I have been to but it certainly rates as well worth the visit. The story line is interesting. There is quite a bit of colorful language but that goes with the characters portrayed. The August Wilson Theater is small so even though we sat far back"
" 	I didn't know what to expect from this show. I wasn't sure if I would know the music as it takes place a bit before my time. I had a great time. I bought tickets for my husband as a gift because one of his friends who is a Broadway expert said it was fabulous. We had great seats and a fun night. The show has many"

" 	My wife and I were in NYC on a fun trip and went to this musical on Saturday evening Nov . Over the years we have been to a number of musicals before but this one may be our all time favorite. The energy of the singers and the quality of their voices is incredible. The story itself is very powerful and while tragic at times it is still a positive ending and message. If you have never been to a musical before you need to go to this one and if you have been to musicals before I think this one will also be one of your all time favorites.			 	: performance on Saturday Nov "

The show was fantastic - great songs -great singing and a thoroughly enjoyable experience. From the minute the curtain went up to the final bow the audience was singing along with some well know songs. The story of how the group evolved over the years and the ups and downs of the main characters kept our interest for the whole show. If you see one show make it this one! We got tickets on the night from Times Square ticket hs and saved quite a lot on the price. 			 	Fast paced"
" 	This was the best show we've seen in many years. Unfortunately we had to see it in the August Wilson Theater. The seats in this theater are for very small people and we are average in size. There is absolutely no room in front of the seats for your legs and impossible for someone to get out of the isle past someone sitting down. Only one bathroom for each gender which was an impossible situation in such a large crowd. BUT"

" 	A show that really lives up to the hype. We bought reduced tickets at the South Sea Port ticket clearance shop for the same evening. The Q took over half an hour in the cold but it was worth it. We were not sure where in the theatre we would get but we were amazed at how good the seats were. The staging and sound really made it a show to remember with great songs sung by talented performers. The score is naturally very strong and the simple physical staging was very effectively used in combination with subtle and clever use of screens and stage craft. Definitely one of my favourite shows and to see it on Broadway just makes it all the more special. A really good night enjoyed by all of the family.

" 	The Franky Valli story was vividly re-told and most importantly included most of the body of music written and performed by Franky Valli and the Four Seasons. The four main characters brilliantly sang and performed throughout the entire performance. The cast took the audience personally through the ups and downs involving the personal lives of the group. You will walk away not only understanding the pains of a life-time performer but with a greater appreciation of their songs and accomplishments that have lasted through entire generations and even more to come.

" 	If you are familiar with the Four Seasons music you will definitely enjoy this play a lot more. Fabulous play & the music was tops. We really enjoyed the play a lot & it was very well done. Definitely well worth seeing. There was an understudy on a Saturday night for the lead character of Frankie Valli. He was definitely not nearly as good as the other  principal actors. We saw the movie but liked the play a lot better.  A criticism: the set design was not much & I do like to see great set designs.  I would highly recommend this show- it tells the story of the group besides just singing the songs. Go - you will enjoy it! if you like my review"

" 	Great show if you were/are a fan of their music. Due to language parents need to consider this. Also bunch of dirty jokes in there. I laughed along but I'm sure the uptight people out there must of been cringing. Sat nd row Mezz. Great seats as there are elevated portions of the show. Why not  stars? Deducted  due to the seats. Not very comfortable and you are crammed into them. If you have a large frame good luck.			 	Great Broadway Show	gojammin	--	"

I went with my friend and my sister and we were singing and bobbing our heads to all of the music. The whole story kept me so intrigued. I was sad when it was over.

" 	The production numbers were fine but stopping in the middle of one to finish a story nobody was paying attention was a waste of time. Finish the number than chat about history. Nick was very good but Frankie didn't have the depth and range. If you like Franki Valli and the Four Seasons this is for you. Hopefully you don't get the lod mouth obnoxious fema who had to be told to shut up because so many patrons complaine. Total lack of respect for the performers as well. Some people are just rude and no they were not New Yorkers they know better. Even then the big mouth women then had to be told to turn her cellphone off in the second act despite warnings.

" 	""There is a reason it won Best Musical  years ago! Because it truly is a blast from the past and a blast to see! The music is wonderful and the actors truly do an amazing job of bringing this story to life. Do realize that there are  different actors who play Frankie Valli though. We overheard that some people were expecting a guy from Dancing With The Stars to be there and were disappointed it was his """"understudy"

" 	Never been to a broadway play and I was not really expecting a whole lot with this one. The Four Seasons was well before my time so again not really expecting much.  This was incredible. It's a actually an intriguing story about the Four Seasons and how they came to stardom along with music and everyone playing out the scenes. Great musicians"

" 	Saw three times with original cast. You will be singing along in your seats to this still relevant 's-'s music. John Lloyd Young best Frankie Valli"

A big shout out to Richard H. Blake who played Tommy DeVito and Mauricio Perez who played Frankie Valli who both had stellar performances throughout.  The show is about four young lads trying to make it into the music industry in an era typically full of corruption and lack of guidance. The story entails how they met"

" 	This play has great energy and was a great night out. Todrick Hall is amazing as Lola. Love his voice and he is an incredible actor! Aaron Finley as Charlie Price is so talented.  I would recommend entering the lottery. You can enter for an entire week period of time. I entered for  shows and did win the second one. However when you lose they send you a code for significantly discounted tickets which I had used before my winning email. Our seats were in the mezzanine row R for $. It is high and far from stage: still amazing but hard to see details. There was an offer of orchestra for $ but they were gone by the time I went to the box office so be sure to follow link to Ticketmaster as soon as you are offered code.

This story is familiar to us we have the DVD but it is such a great story we wanted to see it live. We were not disappointed the atmosphere was buzzing and the key actors excellent"
" 	You'll see why it got so many Tony nominations. Gorgeous set and costumes. Lola is fantastic. It may remind you of Hairspray and la Cage a bit. Is it the most credible story---no. The woman who plays the factory worker iwth a love interest in the lead also gives a sterling performance. This is something to see for fun and to remember you saw these two stars in their break-out ro. The lead is a perfect part for Hollywood actors (TV) to do their star turns for years to come.

" 	The performances in the show were as good as you would expect from a Broadway show although as a Brit I found some of the 'British' accents grated. What ruined the evening for us though was the size of the theatre. My boyfriend is  foot  and couldn't even sit straight in his seat because there wasn't enough leg room. I needed to go to the toilet at the interval and had to fight my way through two floors of people standing shoulder to shoulder in order to join a queue of - women. I ended up getting back to my seat after the performance had restarted which meant half a row of people had to stand up as there wasn't enough leg room for me to squeeze through. Broadway shows aren't cheap and are as much about the theatre experience as the actual show so it was disappointing that our enjoyment of the show was marred by the size of the theatre. 			 s on Broadway	Great show let down by the size of the theatre	Katyajv	--	"

I don't know whether the songs were difficult to sing or the actors were having a bad night but the leads occasionally struggled.  This show was a major disappointment.  Maybe after seeing Motown and Beautiful I expected as much from the music. That may be unfair because the songs in those shows were all huge hits and very 'singable'. Still"

They do sell fancy drink cups I think they were $ for a soda/pop and then you could 'sell' the cup back for $. We just kept the cups obviously. A nice souvenir. The theater isn't too big or small. I like that because it is much more personal and a better experience. The show itself is amazing. The music is sing-a-long worthy and the stage present from all the singers was to die for. They do such an amazing job.  My husband enjoyed it as well even though I was a bit sketchy on how he would take all the drag queens. But he actually said it was a great show and a lot of fun!

We mentioned it to our tour guide (Free tours by foot) that we planned on seeing this and he suggested trying for the lottery draw on the Sunday afternoon at pm. I must admit I was extremely sceptical but husband was dead keen to pick up a bargain. At the tour guide's suggestion we arrived just  mins before the close of the lottery and placed our names on the list. We were allowed to ask for  tickets. Well I had to eat my words as my husband's name was drawn out first and we were given front row seats in the RH box on the mezzanine floor.

Jake Odmark was Charlie tonight and he was also brilliant. Jeanna de Waal as Lauren is hilarious and very nearly steals the show. The whole ensemble is terrific and very tight with huge energy. You would not believe this show has been running for a few years now as it's very fresh however I'm sure with cast changes along the way to keep it fresh.

" 	""Whenever the girls are on stage you will really get into the show. Also when Billy Porter gets into a scene you will be having a lot of fun. Unfortunately the character performing Charlie across from Billy was lame. My opinion. His acting took away from the show and you were left waiting for Billy or the """"girls"""" to come back onto the stage to give it some oomph. Lauren and Don's characters were acted very well. Maybe it was simply a down day for the actor playing Charlie. Go to see the play for the second act.

The show had a lot of humor and the actors were good and if more shows where like this one I would go more. The only reason I give it any negative is having to wait in a line wrapped around the block for an hour to go in as the doors don't open until almost show time which I'm not uses to at the few times we have been to the theater at home. Also didn't like that when I bought a drink I has no choice but to buy the plastic show cup"
" 	This is by far one of the BEST shows I've EVER seen on Broadway! The music"
" 	 s conveys a message that we really need to hear. It doesn't matter who you are or how you live that matters. It's about people coming together for a common purpose. Some times differences of opinion may get in the way but in the end it reminds us is that the only true thing worth while in today's world is to care about one another. The power of the music and the acting really makes this the greatest feel good show to come to Broadway in along time. I enjoyed every aspect of this show so much that I'm seriously thin about seeing it again. If you're not sure what musical you want to see all I can say is make it  s. You won't be disappointed.			 s on Broadway	The must see musical	kennygriffinlancaste	--	"

The show itself rocks along at a crac pace (I could not believe how quickly two and a half hours passed) with sold and energetic performances all round. The musical numbers and dance routines are carried off with panache and J Harrison Ghee is outstanding as Lola.  It is true there are some """"dodgy"""" English accents but I think these actually add to the charm. Great show!

I paid good money to see the Tony Award winner perform in the lead role & even trudged through the snow to see her perform but never got the chance. But instead got a second rate performer.

" 	My husband and I were in NYC for the weekend with no set plans. Several friends had recommended this show. I didn't realize   had written so many songs. We are in our late forties/early fifties and really enjoyed it but I would love to take my  year young mother to see this show since she grew up with that music. I would have to try to keep her from singing along...LOL! The show"
" 	Being huge   fans we were extremely excited to see the Broadway show. The music brought back wonderful memories of being a teenager in the 's. The acting and singing were superb. The only complaint I have is that I ordered tickets online and on arrival found they were not in the location I selected. It didn't dampen our evening due to the seats we did receive had a glorious view.			Beautiful - The   Musical	Delightful Evening	Grandgracie	--	"
" 	I had mixed feelings about seeing this show as I wasn't really a fan of Carol  growing up. WHAT A SURPRISE!!! It was one of the better shows I've seen! I had no idea of all the songs (that I love) that were written by Carol ... OR how she had gotten the idea to write them. I always find that interesting how all the songs you hear actually derived from certain things that happen in a singer or groups life. It was such a great story and I now have a much greater appreciation of Carol  and her songs. My husband and I enjoyed it so much that we are going back to see it again with my sister and her husband. The theatre (Songheim) is on the small side so ANYWHERE that you sit is a good view of the stage. I love all the theatres in New York. They are all so ornate and lovely....and this theatre is no different. Of course you are right in the heart of Times Square and the Theatre District so there are tons of restaurants to choose from....and its not a far walk to Grand Central Station if you are ta the train. P.S. I would say this show is suitable for ages  and up and it lasts for a little more than  hrs.			Beautiful - The   Musical	What A Surprise!	tweety	--	"
" 	""I really enjoyed this musical. The   actress was amazing! She looked like her and she sounded just like her as well. It was touching to see how her life evolved and I had no idea she wrote so many songs that we all know! Incredibly there is no cursing and I was so appreciative of that. The only challenge is that my husband is '"""" and the seats are very close together as are the rows. He was uncomfortable and the theater did get warm.""			Beautiful - The   Musical	Excellent!

" 	This show was in a very old Theatre and was quite dark in settings during the whole perfomarnce. However we had seats about  rows from the stage near the ochestra which meant we had a good view.(my view was blocked by a person quite a lot taller being in the seat directly in from of me so had to move from side to side if actors moved to right hand side of stage to perfom Excellent perfiormance which was very enjoyable and sad towards the finale. Would add that there were small children sat quite near to my daughter and myself and I personally found some of the context inappropriate for young children . One of the children beside us also cried quite a lot because of what was happening at times on the stage. Rather long show -  hours in total. - but definetly worth seeing if you have the chance when in New York. No cameras allowed and all mobile phones have to be turned off. Staff extremely strict to a point of being quite abrupt to convery this message.to audience. (Someone near us kept using phone during interval and had not turned off before perfomance restarted and was repeatedly told to turn if off in a very offhand manner)			 Miserab	Excellent Perfomance throughout	EKSKS	--	"

One of the best shows I have seen so far and I saw the London Cast years ago. But they put a great show. I took my  y/o son for the first time on Broadway and he was amazed and wanted to see it again. I highly recommend this show. 			 Miserab	Amazing Cast	JanetR	--	"

" 	A new Verizon f the classic. It left a little to be Desired. The new version made some major assumptions in the development of the storyline"
" 	we see almost all musicals over last  years. This is the best musical ever. Best story"
" 	If you love the movie you'll love this production. It felt as if it was staged to have a movie feel vs a stage feel. Although the performers all had great voices it felt mis-cast. There was no connection between the cast members or between the cast members and the audience. It didn't draw you in. I felt as if I were at a concert. The audience on the day of our show felt more like movie goers. No theater etiquette. Lots of cell phones were still open and ta pictures; lots of tal; lots of food. Have seen the show before and it just didn't cut it this time.			 Miserab	Disappointing	mrsomes	--	"

Really enjoyed the show was amazing how different it the theatre feels in America lots of whooping and cheering compared to the silent applause in the Uk!

" 	I originally saw  Mis in  with the original cast members (Colm Wilkinson). I just love it. I wanted my daughter and wife to experience the best show ever to run on Broadway. So we got tickets and saw the show the other night. The actor who played Jean was an understudy. He was very good. If he was the understudy"

" 	""I love this show! This was the first time I had seen it in play form and the Broadway performance was fantastic. I love the singing. It was amazing and filled the theater. I am not an expert at the different actors but I was happy with each one. The leads were strong with good voices and the little boy was amazing. One thing I did not like was the bawdiness in a couple of scenes. I wasn't expecting that since I had only seen the movies. I thought it was vulgar and intended for laughs (which it got - so I might be in the minority). It could have been toned down and still been funny. I would not take children to this performance. But it did not keep me from loving this show. I do recommend using the ladies room before the performance and if you intend to visit during intermission - jump up from your seat and run! There was an extremely long line even though they had the funniest bathroom moniters/ushers I have ever seen. These women """"barked"""" orders like they were evacuating a sin ship. They weren't trying to be funny but were dead on serious. You will meet them as soon as you enter the theator and I will say it added to my total enjoyment of the experience. Do not cross them!! Ha. I want to go again. love"

" 	This is the classic of all Broadway shows. Ramin's version of Bring Him Home was so powerful and moving. The female leads of Fantine and Eponine were good but not great.

The show didn't disappoint at all. The whole cast were superb but Ramin's rendition of Bring Him Home was first class. This was definitely a high light of our time in New York.

The cast is outstanding. Ramin Karimloo is the best Jean Valjean I've ever seen anywhere. His singing gave me goosebumps. Fantine (Caissie Levy) made me cry. And Keala Settle & Cliff Saunders played a ly perfect Madame Thenardier & Thenardier. I'd love to see it again.			 Miserab	One of my favorites!		--	"

Ramin Karimloo is amazing in his lead role as Jean Valjean. His voice is like smooth butter and I could listen to it all day. We had a few understudies and they were all AMAZING!

" 	This is a good production with an interesting twist. Having seen this before I was intrigued to see how the lack of a revolving stage floor would play out. Instead there were some moving parts and great graphic effects that worked very well. Everything moved smoothly and quickly from scene to scene. The acting and singing were very good. My  and  year old granddaughters love the production.  Of special note"
" 	Great cast. Not a dry eye in the theater. Totally worth the money. The theater itself was a little cramped"

" 	Believe it or not but I had never seen  Mis before. I saw the film version last year. I went to see it for one reason - Mr Ramin Karimloo. I have seen him as the  in London in both The  of the  and Love Never Dies and he is an incredible singer. I wanted to finally see  Mis and when I learned that he was playing Jean Valjean on Broadway it could not be more perfect. And he did not let me down. I went on a rollercoaster of emotions in under  hours. The entire cast was absolutely fantastic. I could not ask for a better evening at the theatre. Well done everybody!

" 	""Too often"
" 	""For any who have seen  Miserab in the past you are in for a thrill of a lifetime! Up until now I never thought I could have seen a better actor portray the lead than Colm Wilikinson. Ramin Karimloo has shown me that he can play Jean Val Jean to that level. His signature solo """"Bring him home"""" brought a standing ovation from the audience. His nemesis Javert is equally portrayed as mean and cruel by the excellent talents of Will Swenson. The famous """"turntable"""" used in the original performances has been removed and replaced by the artwork of Victor Hugo who wrote the novel as well as with computer imagery. Believe me you'll never miss it because every detail is still there. The set extends on the sides partially into the audience to give you more of a """"feel"""" of the drama. Please note however"

" 	We had close seats in the balcony which gave a great view of the stage. We did an afternoon showing and were Impressed by the special effects as well as the sets themselves. Very crowded in an older theatre. There was even a woman traffic director for the men's restroom - and believe it or not - it was needed. Bought our tickets directly from the theatre and did not have to pay a middleman fee. Don't wait for same day to see what's left"

Jean Valjean (i think this was played by Ramin Karimloo) was absolutely superb and came across as a much stronger character than Javert. Gavroche was so cute and was perfect in this role adding a comedy value at all the right times and tears later on. I think this was played by Gaten Matarazzo.

My son gave me these tickets for Mother's Day and we travelled from Saskatchewan to see the show! It was AMAZING! The whole cast is so talented. Ramin is beyond awesome! He was so gracious and personable signing autographs after the play - even ta selfies with fans! I can't say enough about this show! I'd go back in a heartbeat!!! The only one negative experience was the extremetly rude security man who chastized a group of teen girls for standing in the wrong place to get autographs after the play. He was extremely rude and did not need to be. He could have relayed his information without embarrassing them with his sarcasm. Other than that - one of the best evenings of my life!!!!!

" 	This production of  Miserab is outstanding. The cast is excellent with no weak links at all-the young performers were flaws as was the entire cast. the cast were all able to portray the emotions of each character so well tht it made for a very moving experience. I had seen the movie version first a couple years ago and enjoyed that but this was more enjoyable as the cast made it seem more real and emotional at a personal level the special effects and sets were amazing as well and really brought things to life. it has been playing for a long time for good reason!

" 	I am still torn between  and  Miserab for best musical of ALL TIMES. But I will just stop comparing them. Both are excellent in their own way.  Miz has very good music"

" 	What I thought would be the highlight of our trip was my biggest disappointment.  Mis is beautiful story of second chances and redemption. The director's addition of humor ruined the experience. The humor was sexually crude verbally and with the use of gestures. I would be more explicit but it's too embarrassing for me to do so. Two guys kissed which was not in the original book of course. The young boy"
" 	We hadnt booked any tickets in advance but were lucky enough to get some on the day. (Under the red stairs on Times Square where you get discounted last minute deals). View was excellent from the seats and performance was very well done. Would definetly recommend to anyone loo for a broadway show. Free programs as well!			 Miserab	Would go again 	btr	--	"

" 	On spring day March  I went to Imperial Theater in New York to watch  Miserab. The theater was huge and classic and the seats are very well positioned. We were seated on the rear mezzanine level on the upper right corner yet we can still see the actors from our end. The orchestra music was mesmerizing and the actors were amazing - their voice is a gift of art - I can really feel the voice surrounding the theater. The play was spectacular and the theater is the perfect place to stage it. Indeed"
" 	I enjoyed this a lot more than I thought"

" 	My husband and I remembered seeing  Mis way back when and on a weekend away we decided to see it again. This production is very well done on many ways. The actors are superb. Eponine was amazing. The leader of the rebel (his name escapes me) was amazing as well. All the leads were very good.  The only thing is (maybe this was a failing memory) this production has more sexual innuendo and tawdriness than I remember. Nothing shoc. Probably somewhere between PG or PG (younger ones won't catch it). Neither of us remembered that from the previous productions but that could be that we didn't catch it back then or we don't remember it.			 Miserab	Always great - PG or PG	Paul L	--	"
" 	This show may now be my favorite! They transition eveything so smoothly and the stage scenery and props were fabulous! My only negative is that the staff did allow a lot of people to enter during the first  minutes of the performance and that was a huge distraction.			 Miserab	Beautiful performance!

" 	I wrote my two cents on how I feel about the sights and sounds of Times Square on another review but Broadway (sitting down to a show) is a completely different experience. We purchased tickets to watch  Miserab and I have to say it was worth every penny.

The cast were electric. Special mention has to go to the girl who played Eponine. Her broadway debut in one of the most pivotal ro on stage. She's set to go far"
" 	We made a last minute choice to see this show and purchased tickets at around : pm. We got single seats that were in separate rows and they were the last couple tickets available for the evening show($). They were at the far right of the house so you couldn't see the whole stage - wasn't bad"
" 	We have been longing to see Ramin Karimloo perform live on stage for years. The chance to come to NYC to watch our High School sons march in the St. Patrick's Day parade with their band afforded the opportunity to see  Miserab. It was an amazing show and so well done. Many of the performers were excellent but Ramin Karimloo was flaws and his voice is truly unbelievable. Thank you for an outstanding experience. It was so worth the drive all the way from Alabama!!!

" 	While staying in New York I decided to see  Miz at the imperial theater. The imperial is an older theatre and can be squishy for leg room at points but worth it. A fantastic night out. The actor for Jean Valjean was AMAZING!!! His voice was captivating. The time flew by and I didn't want the show to end. All performances were fantastic and moving. The only downside was the actor's voice who played Javert was just not deep enough. Don't get me wrong he did an absolutely amazing job at the part and was so full of expression and looked/suited the part"

" 	I have never seen a Broadway show and frankly I have no desire to see another. I know the story of  Mis well because the movie with Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe is fantastic. My wife and I were able to get tickets that were about / off and the seats were great.  You need to understand that when this play debuted nearly  years ago the critics panned it. They hated it. The reason why  Mis is back on Broadway is because critics don't understand what non critics think makes a great movie. That's why I generally go to movies that critics think are horrible and avoid the ones that they rave about (think interview with a Vampire"

" 	We waited till we got to New York to book the tickets"
" 	This was the third time I had seen  Mis this year. each time in a different location. It was amazing just how different the staging was in New York versus London. The main draw was seeing the show with Alfie Boe"
" 	Got a great discount on ticket prices booked a couple of weeks before through Theatremania then Telecharge. We had excellent seats although seating like in many older theatres was a little cramped. Checked before we booked that Alfie Boe would be performing the night we were due to visit and we were not disappointed"
" 	I had checked the schedule to make sure he was the lead for the evening we chose and we flew to NYC to watch him perform. Of all things"
" 	We were there to see Alfie Bow"
" 	If your loo for a great Broadway show experience you cannot miss going to see this show. It was well worth the expense. I was lucky enough to see it with Alfie Boe playing lead and time just flew past without me noticing. The sets were beautiful"

" 	After half watching the film and being bored senses I was dragged along to see this with my wife while in New York"
" 	Since Sept"
" 	I have seen  Mis many times. A few on Broadway and some local theatre where I live. I came as a lot have said to see Alfie Boe (again). We received notice on the train in from upstate N.Y. that he was out the two days we were in the city. I was bummed but like others have said"

" 	It's hard to enjoy the show when the ushers and security and ticket takers are rude"
" 	Saw this production about six months ago and this time... everyone has upped their game. The singing is inspired and the flow of action is efforts. Both Valjean and Javert are compelling"
" 	Before we booked our tickets we researched to make sure we would be watching  Mis on a night that Alfie Boe was scheduled to play Jean Valjean. We booked front row seats and traveled all the way from Manchester to watch the show so were very disappointed to arrive at the theatre and find out that Alfie Boe wouldn't be performing. Luckily we needn't have worried. Jean Valjean was wonderful as was the entire production. My wife and I also thought that Eponine was outstanding. The production was different to the London one and it was a nice change although I don't think I prefer one over the other"
" 	The original direction of this musical was a great musical. Now that Laurence Connor is involved"
" 	Just fulfilled a dream come true to see  Mis on Broadway. When I booked I didn't know that Alfie Boe would be performing and I have to say it was an amazing thrill to hear him live - sounds cheesy but that voice will live with me forever. We were lucky to see Hayden Tee on his first night as Jalvert and he was awesome. Having been to the West End twice I preferred the Marious and Enjora there but the guys on Broadway were still great. Would recommend to all. 			 Miserab	Awesome	Golfrc	--	"

Was it all worth it?.....you bet it was. Alfie singing Bring him home sitting on the barricade was really something to see / hear & worth the ticket price on it's own.

" 	Having already seen  Miserab previously we knew what to expect but it was great nonethes! The performance of all of the cast members was just great and the production itself was outstanding! We specially love the sewer scene as it was done really really well!  We were originally not going to see the show as we have already seen it but we are glad we did. The only negative (and a minor one at that) was that the seats in the theatre didn't offer much leg room. My main annoyance has nothing to do with the play or the theatre.... not it's with certain members of the public"
" 	""I'd always love the songs from  Miserab"
" 	This show was spectacular! I love every minute. I don't think I can see a show anywhere other than Broadway now. Such amazing special effects too. Great director and cast. A must see if you are in New York!			 Miserab	Best version of  Miserab ever!	LynchyA	--	"

" 	We bought last minute tickets for the evening performance and as we walked back to our hotel past the theatre I noticed the poster saying that Alfi Boe was back on Broadway. To say I was exited would be an understatement as I am a massive fan of our Northern lad. It didn't disappoint"

" 	Several years ago I went to see  Mis in the UK (where I'm from) to see why everyone was singing it's praises and actually left at the half time interval"
" 	This trip to NYC was planned specifically to see Alfie Boe in  Miz. He was wonderful - such a beautiful voice - beyond words!! I have seen the play several times because it's my all-time favorite. I saw him perform as Jean Val Jean in the th anniversary performance on TV and fell in love with his voice. He brings such emotion and beauty to this character. I bought our orchestra seat tickets  months ahead but found out there were good seats available prior to the performance. Everyone in the UK knows about Alfie Boe and we in the US are now embracing his talent in this historical play.			 Miserab	Must See Alfie Boe in  Miz!	Margie B	--	"

" 	I have seen  Mis  times. Twice in NYC"
" 	As always this show is always a great production with a great cast. We booked the tickets in July when Alfie Boe joined the cast in September. I checked the dates before boo"
" 	. Do NOT buy your ticket via Viator or you'll be charged a ridiculous mark up and they don't let you even see where you're going to seat. On top of everything at the theatre you'll still have to queue for the tickets even though they send you an evoucher. . Do NOT attend a matinee session"
" 	I took my mother to see  Miserab for her birthday. We attended a Sunday evening performance. I had purchased the tickets in August using a discount code through Broadway Box. Under $ a piece for th row left orchestra on the aisle.  I was absolutely blown away by the passion and tremendous vocals. Alfie Boe is fantastic. I was happy to see Montego Glover in the cast. love her in Memphis. She has such a powerful voice. Remember that the show has a long running time..almost  hours so may not be suitable for very small children who can't sit that long. Also"
" 	As familiar as I am with this show"
" 	I was incredibly lucky and got my tickets through the TKTS h. I paid $ each for tickets and I was in the orchestra"

" 	Great show ! Just like the movie with an amazing upgrade. The male singer ALFIE BOE is the best one"
" 	Alfie Boe is an AMAZING Jean Valjean! If I was'nt happily married I would persue that man just to here him sing in the shower everyday.  Mis really is a very moving performance. Dramatic but with a few splashes of comedy. I laughed and I cried (as did everyone around me). I highly recommend seeing this show. I've seen several shows in NY and would put this one in my top  favorites. It is a bit risque at times so not a good choice for younger viewers.

Discovering that Alfie Boe was ta the lead role in  Mis on Broadway whilst we were going to be in NYC was the icing on the cake. Alfie certainly didn't disappoint as Jean Valjean. We have seen  Mis in London and this Broadway version"
" 	I love this musical.

My daughter & I visited the city to see a play and went to the TKTS h and got tickets for the Sat. p.m. show. The understudy took over the Jean Valjean role and he was great! The audience gave him a couple minutes of ovation at the end of the show. Powerful show and was so surprised at the levity via the Master of the Inn. The innkeeper had so much fun with the role and passed it along to the audience. Both of us were happy we ended up selecting this play. Seventh row seats didn't hurt either.

We were a couple rows from the front on the second level and the view was great. We got our tickets the day before our show for half off - you just don't get to choose your exact seats but just the general section. I encountered one really rude and one really amazing staff member so it averaged to a decent staff interaction. We both felt like we were slightly let down by the performance but couldn't put our finger on it.

" 	I have seen  Mis three times. It never fails to entertain and move me. The music will stay with you long after you leave the theater.

" 	I saw  Miserab on the West End in London which was outstanding. So"
" 	""It seems fitting that as I prepare to break up with New York"
" 	I've been to several other live performances off of Broadway... In other cities... The acting and singing in  Miz were definitely top notch and kept us enthralled.  The theater is small and a bit tight. They serve over priced candy and drinks ($ a piece). But it is Broadway.... And sometimes Twizzler bites are worth the splurge.  Bottom line... You're not paying for a fancy theater experience"
" 	""I must admit I thought this would be a """"miserable"""" experience. My daughter asked for it as a graduation gift. And so I went! Best musical I have ever seen. The cast was more than outstanding! I hung on every note. This is an impeccable sung through musical. A must see! Be quick"
" 	The singing"
" 	Third time seeing the play and it did not disappoint! John Owens-Jones was incredible. We sat nd row and i was afraid it would be too close and that the seats were going to be super small so we were surprised how amazing the seat location was and the seats were very comfortable. No a lot of extra room but totally fine. Bathrooms were very busy but moved along very quickly. We love everything about it!! 			 Miserab	Great Experience! 	kdono	--	"

" 	This production did not disappoint! I was so excited to see it on Broadway in NYC! The group I was with didn't want to spend too much on tickets and we all wanted to sit together (there were  of us) so we purchased them well in advance. We ended up in the front of the rear mezzanine and still had a good view.  The cast did a fantastic job and brought us to tears. I'm so sad this show is leaving in September. I may just have to make one more trip up to see it before then! 			 Miserab	One of my favorites!!	bluebonnet-and-bat	--	"

" 	An absolute must for theatre lovers. We were lucky enough to see Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean but every member of the cast was fantastic. It was slick and spectacular. My friend and I sat in the rear mezzanine and the seats were absolutely fine - not cramped and a good view of the stage. During the break the queue for the ladies was ridiculous but amazingly there was time for us all. It was the highlight of  for me. Worth every penny and more.			 Miserab	The best show I've ever seen!

" 	One of my all time favourite musicals. I watched the film a year ago and I told myself that I would watch it in the West End after a year had passed. Fortunately I was in NYC after my self imposed embargo had ended and I could not pass up the opportunity to watch it on Broadway.  I found that some parts were more impactful when I watched the film due to a number of reasons the main one likely to be that it was my first exposure to the the story. However"

" 	""My wife and I have seen  mis three times in London's west end the last time in January  so we did wonder what to expect in NY.  We were blown away. A performance with a harder edge and staging and visuals that blew the London staging away. My nude said she now felt short changed by the London performance so fantastic was the staging on Broadway.  You were hit immediately by a fantastic boat scene with the criminals rowing away more reminiscent of the film then the London opening scene in a """"field""""  One outstanding song after another was performed to such a high quality you had to remember to breathe between scenes. The master of the house and his mistress as ever came close to stealing the show with magnificent interpretation and presentation they were brilliant.

" 	Having seen  Miserab in London and love it we were bought tickets to see the show on broadway with Alfie Boe. The set was spectacular in as much the front sides of the theatre were incorporated. Alfie Boe just blew me away. Just wonderful to see and hear him sing live. The whole cast were just wonderful in portraying such a great story...We had front seats on the first level. They come highly recommended as does the show if you are visiting New York..			 Miserab	Fantastic	Kathya	--	"
" 	I saw the production in the late 's love it and brought my tween daughter last week so she could enjoy it too. it was good but one star off for the ads touting Alfie Boe but apparently not delivering on that a good portion of the time. He was not there the night we went (Friday) and he is slated not to show up on any Sunday (one of the better days for wor people to attend). And in addition to that"
" 	Just saw it for the th time and already have my ticket for #. This production is fantastic. They have me with the first note of the overture. The score is wonderful and there is just enough humor to break up the seriousness of the story. I saw Alfie Boe one of the  times. He was great -- but so were all the others. I hope the theatre goes back to Wednesday matinees because it is an added bonus to be in the theatre when students are there on a school trip and I get to hear their excitement during intermission. I cannot recommend this show enough. If you have not seen it"
" 	Unbelievable! Saw with my daughter and wife. Had no clue about the story but was locked in within the first minute and never wanted it to end. Some of the best vocal performances we saw during the Summer of ' in NYC. Ramin Karimloo played Jean Valjean. Enough said! Staging and production was amazing. We bought rear orchestra seats and were still very close.  Waited at the stage door with my daughter and the entire cast could not have been nicer to her in chatting"

" 	This is an excellent production. The theater is a bit small"

" 	Absolutely spectacular"
" 	Excellent show. The songs for the part of Jean Valjean seemed to be written especially for Mr. Alfie Boe. He sings from the heart with a perfect voice. It was the best production of  Miz I've even seen live. Mr. Boe will only be performing until the end of February and the show itself is closing in a few months. If you do nothing else while in NYC"
" 	I cannot believe it took me so long to see this show. We went just before it went off Broadway and we really liked it. I am glad that I finally took the time to go see if before we lost our chance. Of course the set was awesome and the songs are one of the best out there. The costumes were great and all of the actors did an awesome. I hope that this will make a come back to Broadway in the future.
